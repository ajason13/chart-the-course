# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains the initial Chart the Course browser app scaffold plus governance docs. Runtime source lives in `src/`, Playwright smoke tests live in `test/e2e/`, and deterministic fixtures live in `fixtures/`. Root documents define project policy and status: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ATTRIBUTION.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and `LICENSE`. Focused decision records live in `docs/`, including tile-provider, governance-workflow, legal-disclaimer, reference-reuse, and Overpass-contract guidance. Automation lives in `scripts/`; `scripts/compliance.sh` delegates to the canonical npm compliance flow. Dependency metadata is tracked in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and generated `sbom.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm ci`: install dependencies from the lockfile.
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite app on `127.0.0.1`.
- `npm run verify:scaffold`: enforce exact direct dependency pins, Node 24,
  React bootstrap, and SHA-pinned/read-only CI policy.
- `npm run build`: type-check and build the browser app.
- `npm run test:unit`: run Vitest unit tests.
- `npm run test:e2e`: run Playwright smoke tests against the local preview server.
- `npm run check`: run app build, unit tests, and Playwright smoke tests.
- `npm run generate:sbom`: regenerate `sbom.json` with CycloneDX.
- `npm run license:check`: run production dependency allowlist and denylist checks.
- `npm run audit:prod`: run `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`.
- `npm run compliance`: run SBOM generation, license checks, and production audit.
- `scripts/compliance.sh`: shell wrapper for the same compliance flow.
- `git diff --check`: catch whitespace errors before review.

The current React app shell is intentionally local-first and fixture-backed.
Use Node 24 LTS and npm 11 as declared in `.nvmrc` and `package.json`. Keep
direct dependencies exact-pinned. Do not add Overpass runtime calls, map
providers, basemap tiles, PDF export behavior, additional production
dependencies, API keys, or user data flows unless the selected task explicitly
covers them and governance docs are updated.

## Agent Workflow

Before starting a task, run `git status --short --branch`, read `CONTEXT.md`,
and fetch the current Notion task. Notion is long-term memory; `CONTEXT.md` is
active repo memory. Move active Codex work to `3. In Development (ChatGPT)`,
then to `4. Final Audit (Claude)` for review, and only mark `5. Done` after
Claude findings are resolved or explicitly accepted. For docs-only governance
tasks, the Gemini/Claude planning handoff may be skipped only under
`docs/governance-workflow.md`; final Claude audit is still required.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Keep Markdown concise, source-linked where policy depends on external terms, and specific to Chart the Course. Use sentence-case prose, fenced command examples, and relative paths such as `docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`. Shell scripts should use POSIX `sh` unless a stronger shell is required; keep `set -eu` for fail-fast behavior. Package scripts should remain explicit and composable.

## Testing Guidelines

Unit tests use Vitest and should sit next to the source as `*.test.ts`. Browser smoke tests use Playwright under `test/e2e/`. For current changes, run `npm run check`, `git diff --check`, and `npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh` before review.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use short imperative subjects, often referencing CTC task IDs, for example `Document CTC-018 tile provider strategy` and `Resolve CTC-003 audit minor fixes`. Keep commits focused on one task. Pull requests should include a brief summary, verification commands and results, linked task or issue, governance impact, and screenshots only when UI changes exist.

## Security & Governance Notes

Do not copy or adapt AGPL-3.0 code from `ace`. Treat `hacker-yardage` and `openyardage-web` as study-only unless permissions are verified. Do not add map providers, production dependencies, API keys, PDF export behavior, or user data flows without updating the relevant docs and compliance posture. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting until a monitored security email exists.
