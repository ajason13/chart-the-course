# Overpass Query Contract

Status: Drafted for CTC-015 on 2026-06-05.

This contract defines the first Chart the Course Overpass API request shape for
course discovery and course-detail loading. It is a design artifact, not a
runtime integration. CTC-004 should implement this contract only after an app
scaffold and test harness exist.

## Goals

- Find candidate golf courses inside a user-selected bounding box.
- Load the selected course boundary and golf-course features needed for a
  blank/vector-only MVP map.
- Keep public Overpass usage bounded, cacheable, attributable, and recoverable
  when the service rate-limits or sheds load.
- Preserve raw OSM entity IDs, tags, geometry, query text, bounding box, source
  URL, and source-check metadata for later ODbL source export.

## Inputs

All coordinates use WGS84 decimal degrees in Overpass order:
`south,west,north,east`.

| Field | Required | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bbox` | Yes | User-selected or geocoded search extent. The client must reject global, country-scale, or otherwise unbounded boxes. |
| `courseName` | No | User-entered search text. Escape for Overpass regular-expression syntax before interpolation. |
| `selectedCourseBbox` | Yes for detail | Bounding box from the selected `leisure=golf_course` result, padded enough to include related features but not nearby unrelated courses. |
| `appVersion` | Yes | Used in the identifying Overpass QL comment. |
| `contactUrl` | Yes | Public project or support URL in the identifying Overpass QL comment. |

Initial guardrail: reject bboxes wider than 0.35 degrees longitude or 0.35
degrees latitude unless a future maintainer decision records a different limit.
This keeps browser requests scoped to a city/neighborhood-scale search instead
of using public Overpass as a bulk data backend.

`courseName` must be treated as a literal string before it is interpolated into
the regex filter. Escape at least these regular-expression metacharacters:
`\`, `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `|`, `^`, and `$`.
Do not concatenate raw user input into Overpass QL.

## Request Identity

Browser JavaScript cannot reliably set a custom upstream `User-Agent`. Every
Overpass QL body must start with a project-identifying comment, and deployed
browser requests should allow the normal app origin/referrer to be sent where
browser policy permits it.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-mvp */
```

If Chart the Course later uses a proxy, self-hosted Overpass, or commercial
provider, that server-side layer should also set a descriptive upstream
`User-Agent`.

## Course Discovery Query

Use this query to find candidate courses within the search bbox. If
`courseName` is empty, omit the first name-filtered block and keep only the
unfiltered `leisure=golf_course` block.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-discovery */
[out:json][timeout:25][maxsize:536870912];
(
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]["name"~"{{escapedCourseName}}",i]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
);
out tags center bb;
```

Expected use:

- Show candidates from `leisure=golf_course` elements only.
- Prefer area or relation results when duplicate node/way/relation records
  describe the same facility.
- Preserve `id`, `type`, `tags.name`, `tags.operator`, `tags.website`,
  `bounds`, and `center` when present.
- Do not request `meta` for the MVP query path; parser tests can use static
  fixtures for metadata-specific cases if needed later.

## Course Detail Query

Use this query after the user selects a course. The bbox must be derived from
the selected course boundary when available, not from a full city or region.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-detail */
[out:json][timeout:45][maxsize:536870912];
(
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["golf"~"^(hole|fairway|green|bunker|tee|water_hazard|lateral_water_hazard|rough|out_of_bounds|pin|cartpath)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["natural"~"^(water|wood|tree|tree_row|scrub)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["landuse"~"^(forest|reservoir|basin)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["water"~"^(pond|lake|basin|reservoir)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["waterway"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
);
out body geom;
```

Required feature handling:

- `leisure=golf_course`: course boundary, candidate facility metadata, and
  source bbox.
- `golf=hole`: hole routing line. Treat as the preferred hole-order source
  when `ref`, `name`, or relation membership is usable.
- `golf=fairway`, `golf=green`, `golf=bunker`, `golf=tee`: primary yardage-book
  geometry layers.
- `golf=water_hazard`, `golf=lateral_water_hazard`, `natural=water`,
  `water=*`, and `waterway=*`: candidate penalty/water hazard layers. The
  parser must keep original tags so later UI can distinguish golf-specific
  hazards from generic mapped water.
- `natural=wood`, `landuse=forest`, `natural=tree`, `natural=tree_row`,
  `natural=scrub`: candidate tree/vegetation hazards where available. These are
  advisory map layers, not proof of playable obstruction.

## Rate-Limit and Error Behavior

The public Overpass instances are shared infrastructure. Chart the Course must
treat them as a constrained public service, not a guaranteed production backend.

- Submit at most one active Overpass request per browser session.
- Cache successful public Overpass responses locally. The durable public
  Overpass cache target remains the 7-day TTL in `ATTRIBUTION.md`; if CTC-004
  ships before durable local persistence exists, session storage is acceptable
  only as a temporary CTC-004 exploration-spike constraint before CTC-019
  establishes durable local persistence.
- Debounce user search input and require an explicit search action before
  querying.
- On HTTP `429`, show a rate-limit state and back off before retrying. Do not
  retry automatically in a tight loop.
- On HTTP `504` or timeout, show a scoped-search prompt asking the user to
  narrow the area or try again later.
- On empty results, preserve the searched bbox and query text in diagnostics so
  future support can distinguish missing OSM data from parser failures.
- Keep request bodies small and avoid `out meta` in the default UI path.
- If expected traffic exceeds public Overpass safety guidance, switch to a
  self-hosted instance or approved provider before broad deployment.

## Attribution and ODbL Records

Every successful detail response must be retained with enough source metadata
to support later ODbL source availability for PDFs and other generated outputs.

Persist or export alongside normalized geometry:

- Raw Overpass JSON response.
- Exact Overpass QL query body.
- Request URL or endpoint host.
- Request timestamp.
- Bbox values.
- OSM element type and ID for every normalized feature.
- Original tags for every normalized feature.
- OpenStreetMap copyright URL:
  `https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright`.

UI and PDF attribution rules remain governed by `ATTRIBUTION.md` and
`docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`.

## Mock Fixture

`fixtures/overpass/synthetic-golf-course.json` is the initial parser-test
fixture for this contract. It is deliberately synthetic: coordinates, names,
and IDs are invented and do not represent a real golf course.

Future parser tests should assert that the fixture can produce:

- One course boundary.
- One numbered hole line.
- Tee, fairway, green, bunker, golf-specific water hazard, generic water, and
  vegetation feature layers.
- OSM IDs, source tags, bbox, and query metadata preserved in the normalized
  model.

  the broad safety guideline of about 10,000 requests and 1 GB download volume
  per day, slot-based rate limiting, HTTP `429` for rate-limit denials,
  `[timeout:*]`, `[maxsize:*]`, and HTTP `504` for resource denials.

- Overpass QL documentation states settings must be in the first uncommented
  statement, supports `[out:json]`, `[timeout:*]`, `[maxsize:*]`, and notes that
  avoiding `meta` limits processing time.
