# CTC-019: Specify durable Overpass cache and request identity policy

## Research target

Act as the specification architect and current-primary-source researcher for
CTC-019, Implement Overpass cache and request identity policy. Produce an
implementation-ready specification for critical review. Do not write full
implementation code or broaden this task into source export, PDF behavior, a
server, or provider adoption.

Gemini has no filesystem or GitHub access. This bundle is self-contained. Base
all project-specific decisions on the exact repository contents embedded below.
Use current primary sources for IndexedDB/browser storage, Fetch/AbortSignal,
Retry-After semantics, browser referrer/origin behavior, Overpass public-service
guidance, accessibility, and security. Include source URLs and access dates.
Clearly separate sourced facts, project constraints, inferences, and
recommendations.

## Current project and gate state

- Repository: Chart the Course, Apache-2.0 browser app using React, TypeScript,
  Vite, Vitest, and Playwright.
- Current repository state: clean synchronized `main` at
  `f9b3f4ff670cd370b3a48a5b6e5623dd93c84fcf`; latest `main` CI is successful.
- CTC-014 remains Done; PR #6 merged as
  `33ac3cc6afd533a7c05fd6d3403c20b37c6037ea` with required CI successful.
- CTC-019 is `1. Spec Drafting (Gemini)`.
- CTC-004 supplies bounded explicit Overpass discovery/detail requests,
  deterministic cache keys, exact raw response text, source metadata,
  session-cache behavior, cancellation, and accepted hardening notes.
- Accepted CTC-004 hardening requires validation of cached `query`, `endpoint`,
  `completedAt`, `bbox`, and `copyrightUrl`, plus a pre-check of an already
  aborted incoming signal before fetch work.
- CTC-005 normalization consumes validated raw response and source metadata but
  must remain separate from durable raw evidence.
- CTC-007 project state contains user-authored targets/carries only and must not
  be added to the OSM cache.
- CTC-014 recommends direct jsPDF only for a later production-adoption review.
  It remains isolated and outside the production app import path.
- CTC-020 raw GIS source export and CTC-008 production PDF export remain
  separate downstream tasks. CTC-019 may enable later source export but must
  not claim to implement it or satisfy its PDF release gate.
- No feature branch or runtime implementation may begin until this
  specification is critically reviewed and Claude adversarial QA planning is
  completed and critically reviewed.

## Acceptance criteria

- IndexedDB or equivalent browser cache stores fetched OSM course geometry.
- Default TTL is 7 days for public Overpass usage.
- UI has explicit `Refresh course data` action with rate limiting.
- API requests use app origin/referrer where available and prefix Overpass QL
  body with an identifying comment.
- 429/Retry-After handling and exponential backoff are implemented.
- Cached OSM geometry is clearly marked ODbL-covered in exported source files.

The final criterion means CTC-019 must define durable ODbL/source-evidence
metadata suitable for later CTC-020 export. It does not authorize an export
schema, download action, or source-export UI in CTC-019.

## Binding scope boundaries

- Prefer the native browser platform. Do not add a dependency unless current
  evidence proves native IndexedDB cannot meet the reviewed contract and the
  dependency receives explicit later approval.
- Preserve exact raw Overpass response text separately from parsed/normalized
  geometry. Do not reconstruct raw source from normalized geometry.
- Preserve current deterministic discovery/detail cache-key behavior,
  including the accepted trailing colon for an empty discovery name.
- Define whether both discovery and detail responses are durable. Do not
  silently cache user-authored project data, notes, preferences, credentials,
  or unrelated state.
- Strictly validate raw response plus every source field before a durable hit:
  `query`, `endpoint`, `completedAt`, `bbox`, and `copyrightUrl`.
- Invalid, corrupt, incompatible, or expired entries are never fresh hits.
- The public Overpass default TTL is exactly 7 days. Define clock-skew,
  expiration, stale handling, cleanup, and storage-failure behavior.
- Explicit refresh must be accessible, visibly rate-limited, abortable, and
  scoped to the current deterministic cache key. Do not query on keystrokes.
- Define bounded 429/Retry-After and exponential-backoff behavior. No hidden
  retry storms, automatic endpoint failover, proxy, or new provider.
- Pre-check `AbortSignal.aborted` before cache/fetch work and define
  cancellation during storage, waits, backoff, body reads, and fetch.
- Preserve the identifying Overpass QL comments. Allow normal browser
  origin/referrer behavior where policy permits; do not attempt to set a
  forbidden browser `User-Agent`, spoof origin/referrer, or weaken referrer
  policy.
- Keep no more than one active Overpass request per browser session.
- No production PDF behavior, CTC-020 export UI/schema, new provider, API key,
  account, server, cloud sync, analytics, telemetry, external storage, service
  worker, background sync, or unrelated persistence.
- Original code remains Apache-2.0. Do not copy or adapt AGPL or unlicensed
  reference-project caching/query implementations, fixtures, UI, or workflows.
- Use synthetic fixtures only. Automated tests must remain network-isolated.
- Keep direct dependencies exact-pinned and preserve canonical compliance.

## Mandatory research and specification questions

Resolve every question explicitly:

1. Select native IndexedDB or another browser-durable mechanism. Define exact
   database name, schema version, object stores, key paths, indexes, record
   schema, upgrade transaction behavior, blocked/versionchange handling,
   connection lifecycle, transaction boundaries, and failure fallback.
2. Decide whether discovery and detail responses are both durable. Define how
   existing deterministic cache keys map to durable records and how temporary
   session entries are migrated, ignored, or retired without changing keys.
3. Define a strict versioned durable record containing exact raw response text
   and source evidence. Specify validation for record/version/key, raw response,
   query, endpoint, completedAt, bbox, copyrightUrl, request mode, ODbL label,
   and any timestamps. Define dangerous/unexpected-key behavior and maximum
   record/response size.
4. Define the exact 7-day TTL calculation in milliseconds and timestamp source.
   Address invalid dates, future timestamps, clock rollback/forward, boundary
   equality, stale entries, optional stale display only after visible user
   choice, cleanup cadence, and cleanup failure.
5. Define storage degradation behavior for unavailable/blocked IndexedDB,
   quota errors, private browsing differences, failed upgrades, transaction
   aborts, tab concurrency, corrupt records, and write failures after a valid
   network response. Preserve useful app behavior without claiming persistence.
6. Define `Refresh course data`: exact scope, enabled/disabled conditions,
   per-key cooldown, cooldown duration and clock behavior, accessible name and
   status, focus behavior, loading/cancel behavior, stale/fresh replacement,
   failed-refresh behavior, and whether cached data remains visible.
7. Define 429 and `Retry-After` handling using current standards and browser
   behavior: accepted header formats, invalid/past/huge values, bounded
   exponential fallback, jitter policy suitable for deterministic tests,
   maximum attempts, maximum per-delay and total-delay budget, timeout
   interaction, visible status, and no endpoint failover.
8. Define cancellation precisely. Pre-check incoming `AbortSignal.aborted`
   before durable-cache and fetch work; specify cancellation during IndexedDB
   operations, scheduled waits/backoff, active fetch, and response body read.
9. Verify request identity. Preserve exact leading identifying comments and
   normal browser origin/referrer behavior. State what code must not attempt
   regarding `User-Agent`, `Origin`, `Referer`, credentials, and referrer
   policy.
10. Define how cached OSM evidence is clearly ODbL-covered for later source
    export without implementing CTC-020. Preserve exact raw evidence and source
    IDs/tags; do not alter normalized geometry ownership or mix it with
    user-authored project state.
11. Define React/App integration and state-machine changes. Address cache lookup
    asynchrony, stale/fresh/refreshing/cooldown/retrying states, race prevention,
    one-active-request behavior, stale request protection, useful errors,
    accessible announcements, and existing detail/map/project behavior.
12. Define deterministic Vitest coverage, including fake clock/timer strategy,
    native IndexedDB test strategy or a justified test-only approach, database
    isolation/reset, schema upgrades, TTL boundaries, clock skew, corrupt
    entries, metadata validation, quota/unavailable storage, refresh cooldown,
    Retry-After date/seconds/invalid variants, bounded backoff, cancellation,
    already-aborted signals, and exact raw-text preservation.
13. Define network-isolated Playwright coverage for reload durability, refresh
    UI/cooldown, 429 retries, cancellation during backoff/fetch, storage
    degradation where feasible, request identity/body, no external requests,
    mobile layout, focus, live regions, and axe checks.
14. Identify exact repository docs that must change during implementation:
    `ATTRIBUTION.md`, `docs/overpass-query-contract.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
    `CONTEXT.md`, and any other justified file. Keep CTC-020 and CTC-008
    acceptance criteria intact.
15. Identify narrow unresolved maintainer decisions and recommend conservative
    defaults. State what Claude adversarial QA must challenge before
    implementation is authorized.

## Required research rigor

- Prefer primary sources: WHATWG Fetch, MDN where normative browser guidance is
  needed, IndexedDB specification/documentation, HTTP semantics for
  `Retry-After`, official Overpass guidance, and WAI/ARIA guidance.
- Distinguish normative requirements from browser observations and project
  recommendations.
- Do not assume IndexedDB requests are cancellable in the same way as fetch.
- Do not promise durable storage or quota capacity the browser does not
  guarantee.
- Do not treat stale/corrupt data as a fresh cache hit.
- Do not permit unbounded retries, Retry-After sleeps, cache growth, response
  sizes, or background work.
- Do not invent source-export behavior merely to satisfy CTC-019's ODbL-label
  criterion.
- Do not propose copying caching/query behavior from study-only or prohibited
  reference projects.

## Required response format

Return a self-contained specification with:

1. Scope/readiness verdict and blocking unknowns.
2. Evidence table with primary-source URLs and access dates.
3. Durable-cache architecture and exact versioned schema.
4. Validation, TTL, stale, cleanup, quota, upgrade, and concurrency decisions.
5. Refresh action and accessible UI/state-machine contract.
6. Retry-After, bounded backoff, timeout, cancellation, and request-identity
   contract.
7. ODbL/source-evidence ownership and explicit CTC-020 boundary.
8. Security, privacy, failure-state, and no-network-expansion decisions.
9. Deterministic Vitest and network-isolated Playwright plan.
10. Exact file/change plan, documentation updates, verification plan, and
    non-goals.
11. Adversarial QA red lines.
12. Open maintainer decisions with conservative defaults.

## Completion test

The response is acceptable only if it defines an implementable browser-durable
cache and schema; strict validation; exact TTL/stale behavior; accessible
rate-limited refresh; bounded Retry-After/backoff/cancellation behavior;
request identity; ODbL evidence ownership; degradation behavior; and
deterministic tests while preserving all existing cache keys, raw evidence,
normalized/project boundaries, network isolation, and downstream release
gates.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains the initial Chart the Course browser app scaffold plus governance docs. Runtime source lives in `src/`, Playwright smoke tests live in `test/e2e/`, and deterministic fixtures live in `fixtures/`. Root documents define project policy and status: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ATTRIBUTION.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and `LICENSE`. Focused decision records live in `docs/`, including tile-provider, governance-workflow, legal-disclaimer, reference-reuse, and Overpass-contract guidance. Automation lives in `scripts/`; `scripts/compliance.sh` delegates to the canonical npm compliance flow. Dependency metadata is tracked in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and generated `sbom.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm ci`: install dependencies from the lockfile.
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite app on `127.0.0.1`.
- `npm run verify:scaffold`: enforce exact direct dependency pins, Node 24,
  React bootstrap, and SHA-pinned/read-only CI policy.
- `npm run build`: type-check and build the browser app.
- `npm run test:unit`: run Vitest unit tests.
- `npm run test:e2e`: run Playwright smoke tests against the local preview server.
- `npm run check`: run app build, unit tests, and Playwright smoke tests.
- `npm run generate:sbom`: regenerate `sbom.json` with CycloneDX.
- `npm run license:check`: run production dependency allowlist and denylist checks.
- `npm run audit:prod`: run `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`.
- `npm run compliance`: run SBOM generation, license checks, and production audit.
- `scripts/compliance.sh`: shell wrapper for the same compliance flow.
- `git diff --check`: catch whitespace errors before review.

The current React app shell is intentionally local-first and fixture-backed.
Use Node 24 LTS and npm 11 as declared in `.nvmrc` and `package.json`. Keep
direct dependencies exact-pinned. Do not add Overpass runtime calls, map
providers, basemap tiles, PDF export behavior, additional production
dependencies, API keys, or user data flows unless the selected task explicitly
covers them and governance docs are updated.

## Agent Workflow

Before starting a task, run `git status --short --branch`, read `CONTEXT.md`,
and fetch the current Notion task. Notion is long-term memory; `CONTEXT.md` is
active repo memory. Move active Codex work to `3. In Development (ChatGPT)`,
then to `4. Final Audit (Claude)` for review, and only mark `5. Done` after
Claude findings are resolved or explicitly accepted. For docs-only governance
tasks, the Gemini/Claude planning handoff may be skipped only under
`docs/governance-workflow.md`; final Claude audit is still required.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Keep Markdown concise, source-linked where policy depends on external terms, and specific to Chart the Course. Use sentence-case prose, fenced command examples, and relative paths such as `docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`. Shell scripts should use POSIX `sh` unless a stronger shell is required; keep `set -eu` for fail-fast behavior. Package scripts should remain explicit and composable.

## Testing Guidelines

Unit tests use Vitest and should sit next to the source as `*.test.ts`. Browser smoke tests use Playwright under `test/e2e/`. For current changes, run `npm run check`, `git diff --check`, and `npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh` before review.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use short imperative subjects, often referencing CTC task IDs, for example `Document CTC-018 tile provider strategy` and `Resolve CTC-003 audit minor fixes`. Keep commits focused on one task. Pull requests should include a brief summary, verification commands and results, linked task or issue, governance impact, and screenshots only when UI changes exist.

## Security & Governance Notes

Do not copy or adapt AGPL-3.0 code from `ace`. Treat `hacker-yardage` and `openyardage-web` as study-only unless permissions are verified. Do not add map providers, production dependencies, API keys, PDF export behavior, or user data flows without updating the relevant docs and compliance posture. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting until a monitored security email exists.

### ATTRIBUTION.md

``````text
# Attribution Policy

Chart the Course is an Apache-2.0 project that uses open map data and may
eventually use third-party rendering, geometry, PDF, font, and test
dependencies. This file records attribution requirements that must be preserved
in the product, generated exports, documentation, and release artifacts.

## OpenStreetMap and ODbL

OpenStreetMap data is licensed under the Open Database License. Any web map,
course-data view, printed page, or PDF generated from OSM-derived data must
include visible OpenStreetMap attribution.

Required URL for PDF and print outputs:

```text
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

MVP PDF policy:

- Include an attribution or acknowledgements block in exported PDFs.
- Include the full URL `https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright` in PDFs.
- Use a compact OSM attribution footer or note on map-bearing hole pages unless
  legal review approves a lighter layout.
- Keep OSM-derived course geometry separate from user-authored overlays, notes,
  and player profiles where practical. Merge layers only for display/export.

## ODbL Section 4.6 Source Availability

PDF exports are Produced Works. When a PDF is distributed or shared, Chart the
Course must make the source OSM geometry or the means to recreate it available.
The MVP mechanism is a `Download Raw GIS Source (ODbL)` action adjacent to PDF
export.

The raw GIS source export must include:

- Raw GeoJSON or OSM XML response.
- OSM IDs.
- Bounding box.
- Exact Overpass QL query.
- Source URL.
- `https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright`.

Raw GIS export must ship in the same release as PDF export. This requirement
does not apply to purely private local previews that are not distributed or
shared.

## Tile Provider and Basemap Attribution

CTC-018 selects a blank/vector-only MVP. The deployed MVP must not load
third-party basemap tiles by default and must not use the OSM public tile CDN
without explicit project approval.

Even when no third-party basemap tiles are used, OSM attribution remains
required because the displayed course geometry is OSM-derived.

Required MVP UI attribution for geometry-only views:

```text
Course data © OpenStreetMap contributors
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

Required MVP PDF attribution for geometry-only exports:

```text
Course geometry and map data © OpenStreetMap contributors.
OpenStreetMap copyright and license: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

If a hosted or self-hosted basemap provider is enabled later, the provider's
required attribution must be visible in every UI map view that uses it, included
in PDFs or printed outputs when relevant, and recorded in
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

Current fallback preference if basemap context becomes necessary:
self-hosted scoped PMTiles/Protomaps extracts in project-controlled storage,
followed by MapTiler or Stadia only after plan and attribution review.

## Overpass and Nominatim Request Identity

Browser JavaScript cannot reliably set a custom `User-Agent` header. Browser
API requests must use the deployed app origin/referrer where available and
prefix Overpass QL bodies with an identifying comment such as:

```text
/* chart-the-course/VERSION contact:https://github.com/[org]/chart-the-course */
```

If the project later uses a proxy, self-hosted Overpass, or commercial
provider, that server-side layer should set a descriptive upstream
`User-Agent`.

Default Overpass response cache TTL is 7 days for public Overpass usage. The UI
must provide an explicit "Refresh course data" action, rate-limited to prevent
repeated refetches. Operators using self-hosted or commercial providers may
configure a different TTL, with a minimum guardrail to prevent abuse.

Detailed tile-provider comparison and source notes are in
`docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`.

## Reference Projects

The following projects are study-only unless license compatibility or maintainer
permission is verified:

- `hacker-yardage`
- `openyardage-web`

Do not copy source code, UI structure, query text, generated assets, or
distinctive expressive implementation from unlicensed repositories. Generic
concepts, independently written Overpass queries, and independently derived
standard geometry math are allowed.

The `ace` project is AGPL-3.0 and may be used only for concept-level awareness.
Do not copy, modify, adapt, link, combine, incorporate, or distribute any `ace`
code in Chart the Course. Because Chart the Course is a network-delivered
browser app, incorporating AGPL-covered code can trigger AGPL Section 13
source-availability obligations for the combined or modified work.

## Legal and Trademark Disclaimers

Public docs, app surfaces, sample data, and generated exports must not imply
that Chart the Course is affiliated with, sponsored by, endorsed by, or approved
by any golf course, golf governing body, GPS app, launch-monitor vendor,
simulator platform, map provider, or other commercial brand unless that
relationship is stated expressly.

Avoid third-party brand names in product positioning unless the reference is
nominative, necessary, and reviewed. Reviewed means a logged maintainer decision
with rationale, source or brand being referenced, where the reference appears,
and why it is nominative and necessary.

Do not bundle prepackaged high-fidelity commercial course replicas, proprietary
course maps, commercial yardage-book artwork, or simulator course assets.
Real-course fixtures require a logged review of data source, permission or
open-data basis, attribution, brand/course-name risk, jurisdiction-specific
concerns, and why a real fixture is necessary instead of a synthetic course.

Any generated PDF, print output, source export, or downloadable artifact that
contains OSM-derived course geometry must include OSM attribution in the
artifact, including the full URL `https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright` when
links are not available.

Baseline disclaimer text and monitored legal/trademark source URLs are recorded
in `docs/legal-disclaimers.md`.

# Third-Party Notices

This scaffold contains the following reviewed production runtime dependencies:

| Package | Version | License | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `react` | 19.2.7 | MIT | Declarative application UI |
| `react-dom` | 19.2.7 | MIT | Browser DOM rendering |
| `scheduler` | 0.27.0 | MIT | Transitive React scheduling runtime |

These packages were verified through the production SBOM and license checks on
2026-06-05. Their upstream license files are preserved in installed package
artifacts and represented in `sbom.json`.

## Current Map and Tile Provider Policy

CTC-018 selects a blank/vector-only MVP with no third-party basemap tiles loaded
by default. No MapTiler, Stadia, Protomaps, Thunderforest, OpenFreeMap, Esri, or
OSM public tile CDN runtime dependency is currently adopted.

The deployed MVP must not use the OSM public tile CDN without explicit project
approval. If a basemap provider is adopted later, this file must be updated
before release with:

- Provider name and plan or self-hosting mode.
- Tile/data source and license or terms URL.
- Required UI attribution text.
- Required PDF/print attribution text, including full URLs where links are not
  possible.
- Whether provider attribution is needed in PDFs.
- Whether the provider's data is an ODbL Produced Work and source availability
  applies.
- Verification date and owner.

OSM attribution is still required for OSM-derived course geometry even when no
third-party basemap tiles are used:

```text
Course data © OpenStreetMap contributors
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

## Original Project License

Original Chart the Course code is licensed under Apache-2.0. See `LICENSE`.

## Dependency Notice Policy

Production dependencies must be reviewed before adoption and tracked through the
SBOM and license scanner. Preserve upstream copyright notices, license files,
NOTICE files, and attribution text required by dependency licenses.

Allowed production dependency licenses for the automated compliance gate:

```text
MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC;OFL-1.1;CC0-1.0;Unlicense;0BSD
```

The scanner must fail on:

```text
GPL-2.0-only;GPL-3.0-only;AGPL-3.0;UNLICENSED
```

Packages reporting bare `Public Domain` require manual review and must not be
treated as automatically allowed.

## Current Compliance Command

```bash
npm ci
npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm \
  --omit dev \
  --output-format JSON \
  --output-file sbom.json \
  --validate

# Pass 1 - allowlist
npx license-checker-rseidelsohn \
  --production \
  --excludePrivatePackages \
  --onlyAllow "MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC;OFL-1.1;CC0-1.0;Unlicense;0BSD"

# Pass 2 - denylist
npx license-checker-rseidelsohn \
  --production \
  --excludePrivatePackages \
  --failOn "GPL-2.0-only;GPL-3.0-only;AGPL-3.0;UNLICENSED"
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

Do not run `npm ci --omit=dev` before invoking a devDependency SBOM tool. Do not
use `--package-lock-only` in the authoritative SBOM command.

`license-checker-rseidelsohn` does not support `--onlyAllow` and `--failOn` in
the same invocation, so these must run as separate passes. They also pass
`--excludePrivatePackages` because this scanner reports the unpublished private
root package as `UNLICENSED` even though `package.json` declares Apache-2.0 and
`LICENSE` is present.

## Future Production Dependencies

Before adding MapLibre, Turf, PDF libraries, fonts, map tiles, geocoding
providers, or analytics tooling, update this file with:

- Package or provider name.
- Version or provider plan.
- License and notice obligations.
- Attribution text shown in-app or in generated PDFs.
- Compliance verification date.

# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting for Chart the Course security reports
until the project has a verified, monitored security contact.

GitHub private vulnerability reporting was enabled for
`ajason13/chart-the-course` on 2026-06-05.

Do not publish `security@chartthecourse.app` or any other project email address
until that mailbox exists, is monitored, and has an owner. Setting a monitored
security contact before v1.0 is a launch-blocking milestone item.

## Supported Versions

Chart the Course has not shipped a public release yet. Security fixes apply to
the active `main` branch once the repository is published.

## Security Scope

Security review should include:

- Browser-only handling of course selections, notes, and player profiles.
- OpenStreetMap, Overpass, Nominatim, tile-provider, and PDF-export request
  flows.
- Dependency license and vulnerability gates.
- Generated PDF attribution and raw GIS source export behavior once PDF export
  ships.

The app must not rely on custom browser `User-Agent` headers for API identity.
Use app origin/referrer where available plus Overpass QL identifying comments.

# Governance Workflow

Status: Updated on 2026-06-05 after CTC-018.

Chart the Course uses a document-first workflow. Notion is long-term project
memory, and `CONTEXT.md` is active repository memory for the next agent or
developer.

## Standard Task Flow

1. Fetch the active Notion task and relevant project context.
2. Move the task to `3. In Development (ChatGPT)` when Codex starts work.
3. Update repository governance docs and `CONTEXT.md` as needed.
4. Run verification:

```bash
git diff --check
npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh
```

5. Commit and push according to the task's delivery path.
6. Move the task to `4. Final Audit (Claude)` and provide Claude a
   self-contained audit prompt.
7. Apply blocking or accepted minor fixes, rerun verification, and commit.
8. Mark the task `5. Done` in Notion and update `CONTEXT.md`.

## Docs-Only Governance Exception

For repository documentation or governance-only tasks, separate Gemini research
and separate Claude adversarial planning may be skipped when all are true:

- No runtime app code is added or changed.
- No production dependency, provider integration, API key, deployment behavior,
  or user data flow is added.
- Codex checks current primary sources directly when the task depends on
  provider, legal, standards, or security terms.
- Source URLs and check dates are recorded in the repo docs or Notion.
- Claude final audit still happens before Done.

Do not use this exception for app scaffolds, provider integrations, security
controls, PDF export behavior, data ingestion code, dependency adoption, or
changes that affect deployed behavior.

## Claude Chat Audit Prompts

Claude Chat does not have access to the local filesystem or GitHub by default.
Final audit prompts must be self-contained and include:

- Role and audit stage.
- Task objective and acceptance criteria.
- Prior governance context.
- Commit hash and verification evidence.
- Source URLs and source-check date when external terms matter.
- Exact contents of every changed file relevant to the audit.
- Explicit note when the docs-only governance exception was used.
- Required verdict format: `PASS`, `PASS WITH MINOR FIXES`, or `FAIL`.

Ask Claude to distinguish blockers from minor fixes and to state whether the
task may be marked Done after any minor fixes are applied.

# Overpass Query Contract

Status: Implemented as a bounded CTC-004 browser spike on 2026-06-06.

This contract defines the first Chart the Course Overpass API request shape for
course discovery and course-detail loading. CTC-004 implements the bounded
session-only browser spike; later durable cache and geometry work remain
separate tasks.

## Goals

- Find candidate golf courses inside a user-selected bounding box.
- Load the selected course boundary and golf-course features needed for a
  blank/vector-only MVP map.
- Keep public Overpass usage bounded, cacheable, attributable, and recoverable
  when the service rate-limits or sheds load.
- Preserve raw OSM entity IDs, tags, geometry, query text, bounding box, source
  URL, and source-check metadata for later ODbL source export.

## Inputs

All coordinates use WGS84 decimal degrees in Overpass order:
`south,west,north,east`.

| Field | Required | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bbox` | Yes | User-selected or geocoded search extent. The client must reject global, country-scale, or otherwise unbounded boxes. |
| `courseName` | No | User-entered search text. Escape for Overpass regular-expression syntax before interpolation. |
| `selectedCourseBbox` | Yes for detail | Exact valid bounding box from the selected `leisure=golf_course` result. Bbox padding is deferred beyond CTC-004. |
| `appVersion` | Yes | Used in the identifying Overpass QL comment. |
| `contactUrl` | Yes | Public project or support URL in the identifying Overpass QL comment. |

Initial guardrail: accept only manually entered decimal coordinate syntax with
at most seven decimal places. Reject exponent notation, locale commas,
non-finite values, antimeridian crossing, invalid ordering, and bboxes wider
than 0.35 degrees longitude or 0.35 degrees latitude unless a future maintainer
decision records a different limit. Exactly 0.35 degrees is allowed. This keeps
browser requests scoped to a city/neighborhood-scale search instead of using
public Overpass as a bulk data backend.

`courseName` must be trimmed, limited to 200 Unicode code points, and rejected
if it contains ASCII control characters. Treat it as a literal string with a
single-pass encoder before interpolation into the regex filter: prefix `\`
before `"`, `\`, and each of `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`,
`}`, `|`, `^`, and `$`. Treat `*/` in a course name as ordinary quoted-string
content; it cannot terminate the separate leading comment. Do not concatenate
raw user input into Overpass QL.

## Request Identity

Browser JavaScript cannot reliably set a custom upstream `User-Agent`. Every
Overpass QL body must start with a project-identifying comment, and deployed
browser requests should allow the normal app origin/referrer to be sent where
browser policy permits it.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-mvp */
```

If Chart the Course later uses a proxy, self-hosted Overpass, or commercial
provider, that server-side layer should also set a descriptive upstream
`User-Agent`.

For CTC-004, the app version and contact URL are fixed trusted constants from
`package.json` and the GitHub repository URL. Validate both constants before
query construction and reject control characters or `*/`.

## Course Discovery Query

Use this query to find candidate courses within the search bbox. If
`courseName` is empty, omit the first name-filtered block and keep only the
unfiltered `leisure=golf_course` block.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-discovery */
[out:json][timeout:25][maxsize:536870912];
(
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]["name"~"{{escapedCourseName}}",i]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
);
out tags center bb;
```

Expected use:

- Show candidates from `leisure=golf_course` elements only.
- Prefer area or relation results when duplicate node/way/relation records
  describe the same facility.
- Preserve `id`, `type`, `tags.name`, `tags.operator`, `tags.website`,
  `bounds`, and `center` when present.
- Do not request `meta` for the MVP query path; parser tests can use static
  fixtures for metadata-specific cases if needed later.

## Course Detail Query

Use this query after the user selects a course. The bbox must be derived from
the selected course boundary when available, not from a full city or region.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-detail */
[out:json][timeout:45][maxsize:536870912];
(
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["golf"~"^(hole|fairway|green|bunker|tee|water_hazard|lateral_water_hazard|rough|out_of_bounds|pin|cartpath)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["natural"~"^(water|wood|tree|tree_row|scrub)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["landuse"~"^(forest|reservoir|basin)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["water"~"^(pond|lake|basin|reservoir)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["waterway"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
);
out body geom;
```

Required feature handling:

- `leisure=golf_course`: course boundary, candidate facility metadata, and
  source bbox.
- `golf=hole`: hole routing line. Treat as the preferred hole-order source
  when `ref`, `name`, or relation membership is usable.
- `golf=fairway`, `golf=green`, `golf=bunker`, `golf=tee`: primary yardage-book
  geometry layers.
- `golf=water_hazard`, `golf=lateral_water_hazard`, `natural=water`,
  `water=*`, and `waterway=*`: candidate penalty/water hazard layers. The
  parser must keep original tags so later UI can distinguish golf-specific
  hazards from generic mapped water.
- `natural=wood`, `landuse=forest`, `natural=tree`, `natural=tree_row`,
  `natural=scrub`: candidate tree/vegetation hazards where available. These are
  advisory map layers, not proof of playable obstruction.

## Rate-Limit and Error Behavior

The public Overpass instances are shared infrastructure. Chart the Course must
treat them as a constrained public service, not a guaranteed production backend.

- Submit at most one active Overpass request per browser session.
- Cache successful public Overpass responses locally. The durable public
  Overpass cache target remains the 7-day TTL in `ATTRIBUTION.md`; if CTC-004
  ships before durable local persistence exists, session storage is acceptable
  only as a temporary CTC-004 exploration-spike constraint before CTC-019
  establishes durable local persistence.
- CTC-004 cache keys are
  `ctc:overpass:v1:discovery:{bbox}:{encoded-lowercase-name}` and
  `ctc:overpass:v1:detail:{bbox}`.
- Never query on keystrokes; require an explicit search action.
- On HTTP `429`, show a rate-limit state and back off before retrying. Do not
  retry automatically in a tight loop.
- On HTTP `504` or timeout, show a scoped-search prompt asking the user to
  narrow the area or try again later.
- On empty results, preserve the searched bbox and query text in diagnostics so
  future support can distinguish missing OSM data from parser failures.
- Keep request bodies small and avoid `out meta` in the default UI path.
- If expected traffic exceeds public Overpass safety guidance, switch to a
  self-hosted instance or approved provider before broad deployment.

A minimally valid raw response is an object with an `elements` array. Every
element must be an object with `type` equal to `node`, `way`, or `relation` and
an integer `id`. `elements: []` is an empty discovery or detail response. Any
non-empty valid elements array is success, even when expected feature types are
absent.

## Attribution and ODbL Records

Every successful detail response must be retained with enough source metadata
to support later ODbL source availability for PDFs and other generated outputs.

CTC-004 stores the exact response text plus source metadata in `sessionStorage`
and parses a separate in-memory representation for display. This session cache
does not satisfy later ODbL source-export obligations.

Persist or export alongside normalized geometry:

- Raw Overpass JSON response.
- Exact Overpass QL query body.
- Request URL or endpoint host.
- Request timestamp.
- Bbox values.
- OSM element type and ID for every normalized feature.
- Original tags for every normalized feature.
- OpenStreetMap copyright URL:
  `https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright`.

UI and PDF attribution rules remain governed by `ATTRIBUTION.md` and
`docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`.

## Mock Fixture

`fixtures/overpass/synthetic-golf-course.json` is the initial parser-test
fixture for this contract. It is deliberately synthetic: coordinates, names,
and IDs are invented and do not represent a real golf course.

Future parser tests should assert that the fixture can produce:

- One course boundary.
- One numbered hole line.
- Tee, fairway, green, bunker, golf-specific water hazard, generic water, and
  vegetation feature layers.
- OSM IDs, source tags, bbox, and query metadata preserved in the normalized
  model.

# Tile Provider Strategy

Status: Selected for MVP on 2026-06-04 under CTC-018.

Chart the Course must choose a compliant base-map strategy before any deployed
map scaffold. The MVP must not depend on the OpenStreetMap public tile CDN for
deployed use, must keep attribution visible, and must leave room for a later
provider change without reshaping the yardage-book workflow.

## Decision

The selected MVP strategy is blank/vector-only rendering of OSM-derived course
geometry, user-authored target lines, yardage markers, hazards, notes, and
print/PDF overlays. The deployed MVP must not load third-party basemap tiles by
default.

Fallback path:

1. If users need geographic context beyond course geometry, self-host a scoped
   PMTiles/Protomaps basemap extract in project-controlled storage.
2. If operational burden is too high, evaluate MapTiler or Stadia under a paid
   or explicitly approved plan before enabling hosted basemap tiles.
3. If a provider's terms, attribution requirements, pricing, or service
   availability change materially, disable that provider in deployed builds
   until the policy is re-reviewed.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not use `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` or any other OSM
  public tile CDN endpoint in deployed Chart the Course builds without explicit
  project approval.
- Do not add prefetch, bulk-download, scraping, or offline tile caching features
  against public tile services unless the provider's plan and terms expressly
  allow them.
- Do not hide attribution behind app chrome, overlays, collapsed controls, or
  off-screen UI when a map or map-derived export is visible.
- Keep the tile provider configurable behind a provider adapter boundary when a
  map scaffold is introduced. Course geometry, yardage calculations, and PDF
  export must not assume a specific basemap vendor.

## Attribution Requirements

Even without third-party basemap tiles, Chart the Course uses OSM-derived course
geometry. OSM attribution remains required in UI views and PDFs that display or
export that geometry.

Required UI attribution for MVP geometry-only views:

```text
Course data © OpenStreetMap contributors
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

Required PDF attribution for MVP geometry-only exports:

```text
Course geometry and map data © OpenStreetMap contributors.
OpenStreetMap copyright and license: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

If a third-party basemap provider is enabled later, its attribution must appear
where the provider requires it:

- UI: visible on every map view using that provider, with links when the medium
  supports links.
- PDF/print: visible near the map, in a footer, citation, or acknowledgements
  block as permitted by the provider, including full URLs when links are not
  possible.
- Notices: listed in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with provider name, source data,
  plan or hosting mode, required attribution text, and verification date.

## Option Comparison

| Option | Fit | Attribution | Operational notes | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blank/vector-only MVP | Best for first deployed app. Supports hole layout, yardage planning, target lines, notes, and PDF output without basemap tiles. | OSM attribution still required for OSM-derived course geometry in UI and PDFs. No provider attribution required. | Lowest vendor, cost, API-key, and availability risk. Less surrounding geographic context. | Selected for MVP. |
| Self-hosted PMTiles/Protomaps | Strong fallback when surrounding context becomes necessary. | Protomaps basemap downloads are OSM-derived Produced Works, so OSM attribution is required. Also preserve any Protomaps/OpenMapTiles/style notices that apply to selected assets. | Requires storage, CDN/range-request support, update workflow, integrity checks, and scoped extracts to avoid large planet-file operations. | Preferred fallback. |
| MapTiler | Viable hosted provider after plan review. | MapTiler docs require visible MapTiler and OpenStreetMap attribution; free accounts also require a MapTiler logo. Printed/static media need comparable visible attribution. | Requires API key, plan limits, billing review, and provider-specific UI/PDF attribution checks. | Defer until basemap need is proven. |
| Stadia Maps | Viable hosted provider after plan review. | Stadia requires Stadia Maps, OpenMapTiles, and OpenStreetMap attribution for most styles; Stamen-origin styles require "Map tiles by Stamen Design" with `stamen.com` URL in print. Print must include required URLs such as `stadiamaps.com` and `openstreetmap.org/copyright`. | Requires API key/domain configuration, plan review, and style-specific notices. | Defer until basemap need is proven. |
| Thunderforest | Viable niche/activity-map provider, not a first choice for MVP. | Terms require Thunderforest and OpenStreetMap contributor attribution, with printed-media text using provider and OSM copyright URLs. | Registration and subscription model; no caching proxies or redistribution; more style-specific than needed for yardage-book MVP. | Not selected. |
| OpenFreeMap | Interesting free hosted vector option, not conservative enough for MVP. | OSM-derived attribution still applies; provider terms are broad, as-is, and may change. | Free as-is service with no availability warranty and discontinuation risk. Suitable for experiments, not project default. | Not selected for deployed MVP. |
| Esri basemaps | Mature commercial ecosystem, but excess scope for MVP. | Esri basemaps require Esri/source attribution depending on layer. | Terms, account requirements, SDK/provider coupling, and non-OSM data sources add policy complexity. | Not selected. |

# CTC-007 Claude QA-planning corrections

Date: 2026-06-12

## Disposition

Claude returned `READY WITH REQUIRED SPEC CORRECTIONS`. BF-1 through BF-8 and
Decisions 1 through 10 are accepted except for the consistency corrections
below. These corrections preserve Claude's intent and authorize development.
The rejected Gemini revision remains rejected in full.

## Consistency corrections

1. Target IDs use `/^t-[0-9a-f]{12}$/`; carry IDs use
   `/^c-[0-9a-f]{12}$/`. Both use six bytes from `crypto.getRandomValues`
   encoded as lowercase hexadecimal. Separate prefixes avoid ambiguous ID
   namespaces.
2. V1 does not detect duplicate raw JSON object keys because `JSON.parse`
   resolves them before validation. Remove `DUPLICATE_KEY` as a claimed
   post-parse check. Duplicate semantic target and carry IDs are rejected
   across the complete project.
3. The maximum returned validation-error count is 20 including the
   too-many-errors sentinel. Collect at most 19 field errors, then append one
   sentinel error.
4. Carry sampling returns exactly 65 valid coordinates: 64 bearings plus a
   closing copy of sample zero. Any invalid generated coordinate returns a
   typed carry-generation failure; samples are never silently dropped.
5. Normalize longitude to `[-180, 180)` degrees. Split rendered carry segments
   where two consecutive normalized sample longitudes differ by more than 180
   degrees. The antimeridian test uses a valid maximum 700-yard carry near the
   antimeridian, not the out-of-range 5,000-yard example.
6. Import confirmation occurs after the file-input change event but before
   file reading. Cancel clears the input value, returns focus to the import
   control, and leaves project state unchanged.
7. The success announcement receives programmatic focus through
   `tabIndex={-1}` in addition to `aria-live="polite"`. The error-summary
   heading is likewise focusable.
8. Target placement announces target-specific text; it must not reuse
   CTC-006's measurement announcement `"First point placed"`.
9. The current course source key is the first deterministic normalized course
   candidate. Import/export controls are unavailable when no course candidate
   exists. This does not mutate or replace normalized source evidence.
10. SVG target markers use `role="button"` when they are keyboard/click
    selectable. Ordinary target-list controls remain the primary edit/delete
    interface.
11. Imported dangling target-origin carry records remain structurally valid
    and produce the specified visible error state. They are not silently
    dropped or treated as trusted geometry.
12. Deterministic serialization means fixed property/collection ordering and
    formatting. `exportedAt` intentionally changes between exports and is not
    included in byte-identical repeated-export assertions.

## Accepted implementation rules

- Use Claude's exact v1 project shape, 512 KiB maximum, strict unknown-field
  rejection, dangerous-key rejection, exact schema version, all-or-nothing
  import, course/hole matching, fixed filename/MIME/final newline, and
  requestAnimationFrame object-URL cleanup, subject to the corrections above.
- Use memory-only project state, explicit `measure`, `place-target`, and
  `reposition-target` modes, free geographic targets, explicit label editing,
  immediate delete with single-level undo, and existing pointer/keyboard
  projection behavior.
- Use deterministic tee-origin eligibility, 0–5 carry records per hole,
  1–5 unique ascending integer-yard distances from 1–700, 64-bearing
  geographic rings using existing `EARTH_RADIUS_M`, fixed hole projection,
  clipped carry rendering, visible off-map/origin errors, and the accepted SVG
  layer order.
- Use no new production dependency, no Zod, no Canvas replacement, no
  pan/zoom/rotation/dragging, no notes/preferences, no automatic migration, no
  durable persistence, no CTC-019 behavior, and no logging side effects.
- Final Claude audit remains mandatory after implementation.

# CTC-014 vector PDF evaluation

Date: 2026-06-12

## Decision

Recommend direct drawing with `jspdf@4.2.1` for a later production-adoption
review. The typed export scene is the rendering contract; production code must
not scrape `HoleMap` DOM. `svg2pdf.js@2.7.0` remains a viable translation
option if a later task proves that maintaining direct primitive mapping is more
costly than its extra dependency and SVG-compatibility risk.

Do not recommend the tested PDFKit paths. Both `pdfkit@0.19.1` direct drawing
and `svg-to-pdfkit@0.1.8` translation failed in the current Vite browser build
because `blob-stream@0.1.3` requires the unavailable Node-style `global`
object. Vite also externalized Node `stream`, `zlib`, `fs`, `util`, `assert`,
and `buffer` imports. Adding browser polyfills was not authorized and would
increase complexity and bundle size. `svg-to-pdfkit` also fails the maintenance
recommendation gate.

This decision does not adopt a production dependency or ship PDF export.
CTC-008 remains blocked from release until CTC-020 raw GIS source availability
ships in the same release. CTC-014 uses static fixture text only and does not
add a persistent notes model.

## Fixture experiment

The isolated `/ctc014.html` entry constructs a pure export scene from
`fixtures/overpass/synthetic-golf-course-ctc006.json`, normalized hole
`way/9000060101`, course `way/9000060001`, tee `way/9000060201`, one fixed
target, and one fixed 150-yard tee carry.

The one-page fixture is US Letter portrait, 612 by 792 points, with 36-point
margins. It contains projected point, line, and polygon geometry; required
dash distinctions; route, target, carry, scale bar, yardage row, static note,
disclaimer, visible attribution, and the full printed URL
`https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright`. It makes no network requests and
imports no production app entry.

## Measured results

| Candidate | Browser result | PDF bytes | Pages / box | Searchable required text | Vector / raster evidence |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `jspdf@4.2.1` direct draw | Pass | 9,739 | 1 / 612 x 792 pt | Pass, including © and scale bar | 12 PDF.js path operations; 0 image operations |
| `jspdf@4.2.1` + `svg2pdf.js@2.7.0` | Pass | 10,524 | 1 / 612 x 792 pt | Pass, including © and scale bar | 13 PDF.js path operations; 0 image operations |
| `pdfkit@0.19.1` direct draw | Fail | Not produced | Not produced | Not measured | Browser runtime error: `global is not defined` |
| `pdfkit@0.19.1` + `svg-to-pdfkit@0.1.8` | Fail | Not produced | Not produced | Not measured | Browser runtime error: `global is not defined` |
| Canvas/raster | Rejected control | Not measured | Not measured | Not acceptable | Fails vector requirement by definition |
| Browser print-to-PDF | Deferred control | Not measured | Not measured | Browser-dependent | Not a recommended project-controlled pipeline |

The direct jsPDF structural result was stable across five consecutive runs:
page count, page box, extracted text, path-operation count, and image-operation
count were identical. The focused Playwright test blocks all non-localhost
requests. PDF.js inspection uses a locally bundled worker.

The direct jsPDF path preserves the four-element carry dash intent. The scene
test fixes the logical pattern at `[12, 5, 3, 5]`, and PDF.js structural
inspection confirms jsPDF emits the scaled four-element PDF dash operator
`[8, 10/3, 2, 10/3]`. This is valid alternating on/off PDF dash syntax and is
not silently simplified to a two-element pattern.

The initial SVG experiment silently omitted the scale bar. The test caught the
drop; the SVG scene was corrected and the final result includes searchable
scale text plus a vector line. This demonstrates why export-scene fidelity and
structural assertions are both required.

## Build and dependency evidence

The clean production app baseline was approximately 237.06 kB minified and
74.88 kB gzip. With the isolated experiment retained, the production app entry
remains separate at 226.77 kB minified and 71.59 kB gzip. The isolated
experiment adds:

- experiment entry: 919.02 kB minified, 283.20 kB gzip;
- dynamically loaded PDFKit chunk: 559.69 kB minified, 218.68 kB gzip;
- local PDF.js worker: 1,245.44 kB.

These combined-build figures are not per-candidate production bundle claims.
They demonstrate that the experiment is isolated and that PDFKit plus PDF.js
inspection impose substantial research-only weight.

| `jspdf@4.2.1` | MIT | 30,192,058 bytes | 2026-03-17 |

All experiment packages are exact-pinned devDependencies. No PDF package is a
production dependency. The full installed license summary contains MIT, ISC,
Apache-2.0, BSD, MPL-2.0, BlueOak-1.0.0, CC0-1.0, CC-BY-3.0, Zlib, and 0BSD
expressions; it contains no GPL, AGPL, or UNLICENSED result. The canonical
production allowlist remains unchanged and passes.

`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reports zero production
vulnerabilities. The dev-inclusive audit reports nine existing findings: two
moderate, four high, and three critical. Every reported path is through the
pre-existing `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@2.1.0` toolchain, not a newly installed
PDF candidate. Upgrading that tool remains separately recorded future work.

## Visual regression strategy

Production PDF work should use three layers:

1. Pure export-scene assertions for stable source identities, layer counts,
   layout bounds, non-color distinctions, and required text.
2. PDF.js structural inspection for one-page MediaBox, extracted required
   text, vector path operations, and absence of raster map images.
3. A PDF.js canvas render at a pinned worker/browser version compared with a
   reviewed fixture-page snapshot. Derive the narrowest stable pixel tolerance
   from repeated identical runs; do not use byte-identical PDF assertions or
   inflate tolerance to hide nondeterminism.

CTC-014 proves the first two layers and five-run structural stability. A
production-adoption task must add the reviewed rendered-page snapshot before
shipping PDF behavior.

## Production adoption gate

Before direct jsPDF can move from experiment devDependency to production
dependency:

- obtain Claude final-audit acceptance of this evaluation;
- open a separate reviewed adoption scope;
- update `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, production SBOM, license evidence, and
  security review for the exact adopted tree;
- preserve plain-text attribution and full printed OSM copyright URL;
- keep generation browser-local with no remote fonts, images, uploads,
  executable PDF content, annotations, forms, or imported HTML;
- implement and verify CTC-020 in the same release as distributed/shared PDF
  export under CTC-008.
