# CTC-006 Claude final audit handoff

## Role and stage

Act as final auditor for CTC-006, Render selected hole map with measurement controls. Audit commit `ca1656b` on branch `ctc-006-selected-hole-map`. This bundle was generated from the audited commit using `git show ca1656b:path`. Claude Chat has no filesystem or GitHub access.

## Acceptance criteria

- Selected hole renders with tee, fairway, green, hazards, and scale indicator.
- User can click two points and see yards/meters.
- Map remains usable on desktop and mobile widths.
- Geometry fixtures verify distance tolerance.

## Binding boundaries

Dependency-free native React SVG only. No unassociated-feature rendering, geometry mutation/healing/inference, provider/basemap, persistence, PDF/export, target markers, carry arcs, cache-policy changes, new dependency, external test network, or real-course fixture. Visible OSM attribution and normalization warnings are required.

## Implementation summary

The commit adds pure local equirectangular projection, Haversine yards/meters measurement, truthful logical-SVG scale indication, selected-hole SVG rendering, pointer and keyboard controls, structured warnings, an all-layers synthetic fixture, and Vitest/Playwright coverage. It records Gemini and Claude planning gates.

## Verification evidence

- `npm run check`: passed scaffold policy, build, 30 Vitest tests, and 13 Playwright tests.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh`: passed with 0 production vulnerabilities.

## Required audit focus

1. Challenge projection/inverse determinism, minimum extent, pole handling, coordinate order, and scale-bar truthfulness.
2. Challenge geodesic constants, rounding, clamping, pointer/keyboard state, third-point restart, resize/hole changes, and mobile accessibility.
3. Verify only selected-hole associated features render and unassociated features remain excluded.
4. Verify warnings and attribution remain visible without invented causality.
5. Verify fixture/tests prove acceptance criteria and retain existing behavior/network isolation.
6. Identify scope leakage, dependency changes, hidden diagnostics, logging, or prohibited behavior.

## Required verdict

Return `PASS`, `PASS WITH MINOR FIXES`, or `FAIL`. Separate blockers from minor fixes and state whether CTC-006 may be marked Done after any confined fixes.

## Current Status

CTC-006 is in Development (ChatGPT) - 2026-06-11. Codex selected CTC-006
after confirming `main` is clean and synchronized at `3449748`, the live
CTC-006 and CTC-019 Notion tasks both remain Backlog with unchanged acceptance
criteria, CTC-005 is Done and supplies the normalized WGS84 geometry contract,
and CTC-018 selects blank/vector-only rendering with no third-party basemap
tiles by default. CTC-006 is the correct next dependency because selected-hole
rendering and two-point measurement now have normalized input and unlock later
map workflows. CTC-019 remains independent Overpass cache/request-policy
hardening and must not be absorbed into CTC-006. The self-contained Gemini
specification prompt is at
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-prompt.md`; its 13 embedded
relevant repository files were verified byte-for-byte exact and its SHA-256 is
`4b70fbda3decd646df805a36351e98f67a5020f3769b00fab485a1390e4eef2b`.
Startup-gate verification passed: `npm run check` with scaffold policy, build,
24 Vitest tests, and 12 Playwright tests; `git diff --check`; and the canonical
compliance flow with 0 production vulnerabilities. Do not create a feature
branch or implement runtime code until the Gemini specification is critically
reviewed and Claude adversarial QA planning is completed and critically
reviewed.

Gemini's final CTC-006 revision was rejected on 2026-06-11. Despite the exact
mandatory correction prompt, it abandoned the required React SVG architecture
for layered Canvas/SVG/DOM rendering and reintroduced prohibited pan/zoom,
pin dragging/snapping, multi-touch gestures, localStorage preferences,
out-of-bounds styling, invented coordinate contracts, console logging,
Jest/Cypress tooling, and unsupported accuracy/performance claims. It also
failed to resolve the requested logical viewBox, minimum extent, warning
matching, exact CTC-005 fixture contract, and deterministic keyboard behavior.
No decisions from the final revision were accepted. The authoritative baseline
remains `docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-review.md`. The
self-contained Claude QA-planning bundle is at
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-claude-qa-planning-prompt.md`; its 12 embedded relevant
repository files were verified byte-for-byte exact and its SHA-256 is
`1d4d40adce5601c83c5d1cb1837b4c51d6a1456a3740d5f86a40d6f9e62d2cd0`.
Do not create a feature branch or implement runtime code until Claude QA
planning is critically reviewed.

Claude QA planning returned `READY WITH REQUIRED SPEC CORRECTIONS` on
2026-06-11. B-1 through B-7 were recorded in
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-review.md`. Codex corrected two
internally inconsistent recommendations before development: the circular
minimum-extent algorithm was replaced with a fixed display-only 20-meter
minimum per axis, and the finite nice-scale sequence with an overflowing
fallback was replaced by a generated 1/2/5 sequence that always fits within
40% of the inner logical viewport. Development is authorized on branch
`ctc-006-selected-hole-map`; final Claude audit remains mandatory.
Implementation adds dependency-free local equirectangular projection,
Haversine yards/meters measurement, deterministic scale indication, a native
React SVG selected-hole map, pointer and keyboard controls, structured warning
display, a CTC-006 all-layers synthetic fixture, and focused Vitest/Playwright
coverage. Unassociated features remain excluded, existing CTC-005 fixtures are
unchanged, and no provider, basemap, persistence, export, cache policy, or new
dependency was added.
Pre-audit verification passed: `npm run check` with scaffold policy, build, 30
Vitest tests, and 13 Playwright tests; `git diff --check`; and the canonical
compliance flow with 0 production vulnerabilities.

Gemini's first CTC-006 response was rejected on 2026-06-10 because it ignored
the supplied CTC-006 prompt and replaced the selected-hole rendering task with
an unapproved Fastify/Redis geohash caching proxy and multi-quarter enterprise
infrastructure roadmap. It did not resolve CTC-006 rendering, projection,
measurement, scale-indicator, selected-hole interaction, responsive,
accessibility, or geometry-tolerance decisions. It also proposed out-of-scope
CTC-019 and unrelated work including Redis, geohash tiling, stale-while-
revalidate, distributed locks, upstream aggregation/backoff/failover, XML
normalization, PostGIS, MCP, OIDC/SPIRE, KG-TRACES/PyTorch, new dependencies,
epics, agent workflows, and performance targets unsupported by the repository.
The response is not a CTC-006 specification baseline and does not advance the
gate. The exact replacement instruction is at
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-plan-correction.md`. Keep CTC-006 in
`1. Spec Drafting (Gemini)` and resubmit the correction together with the
original self-contained CTC-006 prompt.

Gemini's corrected CTC-006 response was critically reviewed on 2026-06-11. It
correctly selected dependency-free native React SVG, preserved geographic
coordinates for measurement, proposed latitude-aware projection, chose
geodesic two-point distance, and addressed pointer/touch/keyboard, responsive,
attribution, and synthetic-test concerns. The response was not accepted as
written because it invented normalized types and fixture shapes, rendered
unassociated features as selected-hole fallbacks, proposed incorrect antipodal
handling, and left projection, scale-bar, warning, interaction, and
accessibility rules insufficiently precise. The corrected specification
baseline is at `docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-review.md`. At the
maintainer's direction, Gemini receives one final revision opportunity before
Claude QA planning. The exact revision prompt is at
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-revision-prompt.md`. CTC-006 must
remain out of implementation until the final Gemini revision is critically
reviewed and Claude adversarial QA planning is completed and critically
reviewed.

CTC-005 is Done - 2026-06-07. Codex selected CTC-005
after confirming `main` is clean and synchronized at `918f801`, CTC-015 is
Done and defines the raw Overpass/detail-query contract, and CTC-004 is Done
and merged as `50638ee` with validated raw entities and source metadata.
CTC-005 is the correct next task because pure deterministic normalization is
needed before CTC-006 rendering. CTC-019 durable cache/request policy is an
independent downstream task, not a prerequisite, and remains excluded.
Notion records the selection/dependency rationale and the status move from
Backlog to Spec Drafting. The self-contained Gemini prompt is at
`docs/handoffs/ctc-005-gemini-specification-prompt.md`. The prompt was revised
after Gemini interpreted its original role framing as a request for generic
product-management research; the active prompt now explicitly permits only
CTC-005 OSM/Overpass normalization research. A concise Deep Research
plan-confirmation correction is at
`docs/handoffs/ctc-005-gemini-plan-correction.md` because Gemini continued to
substitute an unrelated saved plan. Do not create a feature branch or implement
runtime code until the Gemini specification is critically reviewed and Claude
adversarial QA planning is completed and critically reviewed.

Gemini's CTC-005 specification response was critically reviewed on 2026-06-07.
Useful recommendations were retained for a pure deterministic normalization
boundary, preserved source evidence, unassociated features, stable warnings,
and synthetic tests. Scope-broadening or unsupported recommendations were
rejected, including Turf/MapLibre dependencies, rendering/z-index concerns,
convex hulls, geometry healing, auto-closing polygons, multipolygon assembly,
spatial containment/proximity association, arbitrary 150-meter thresholds,
area-based conflict resolution, loose hole-ref coercion, merged source holes,
real-course fixtures, and parser-owned PDF behavior. The corrected
specification baseline is recorded in
`docs/handoffs/ctc-005-gemini-specification-review.md`. CTC-005 must remain out
of implementation until Claude adversarial QA planning challenges and resolves
the remaining questions. The self-contained Claude QA-planning bundle is at
`docs/handoffs/ctc-005-claude-qa-planning-prompt.md`; its ten embedded relevant
repository files were verified byte-for-byte exact and its SHA-256 is
`50289cc86f65e835674516b514de245b9abb1d520b6c4a95cba37a2f76709b64`.
Claude QA planning returned `READY WITH REQUIRED SPEC CORRECTIONS`. B-1 through
B-4 and Q1 through Q5 were recorded before development. Codex corrected two
internally inconsistent audit recommendations: source-key conflict winners use
canonical structural ordering instead of order-dependent first-seen behavior,
and discarded duplicate course records do not count as multiple course
candidates. Implementation on branch `ctc-005-normalize-osm-geometry` adds a
pure dependency-free normalizer, strict geometry/tag/ref handling, explicit-ref
feature association, preserved source evidence, deterministic warnings, and
complete/incomplete synthetic Vitest coverage. No rendering, spatial inference,
geometry healing, relation assembly, storage/network behavior, or new
dependency was added. Verification passed before audit: `npm run check` with
scaffold policy, build, 22 Vitest tests, and 12 Playwright tests;
`git diff --check`; and `npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache
scripts/compliance.sh` with 0 production vulnerabilities. Claude final audit
returned `PASS WITH MINOR FIXES` with no blockers and authorized Done after two
test-only additions without re-audit. MF-1 added explicit
`ZERO_COURSE_CANDIDATES` coverage. MF-2 added explicit
`MULTIPLE_COURSE_CANDIDATES` coverage for two distinct unique candidates. No
normalization logic, fixture, dependency, or scope changed. Post-fix
verification passed: `npm run check` with scaffold policy, build, 24 Vitest
tests, and 12 Playwright tests; `git diff --check`; and the canonical compliance
flow with 0 production vulnerabilities. CTC-006 rendering and CTC-019 durable
cache/request policy remain downstream.
PR #3 passed required CI and merged into `main` as `a624fec` on 2026-06-07.
Notion records the merged PR, implementation commit, audit-fix commit, final
Claude verdict, and Done status.

CTC-004 is Done - 2026-06-07. PR #2 (`ctc-004-overpass-search-spike`) passed
required CI and merged into `main` as `50638ee`. It implements the reviewed
CTC-015 contract as a bounded manual-coordinate browser spike. Notion records
the Done verdict, fix commit, merged PR URL, and CTC-019 hardening advisories.
The implementation uses one reviewed Overpass endpoint, native
fetch/AbortController/sessionStorage, exact discovery/detail query shapes,
single-pass injection-safe course-name encoding, strict decimal bbox
validation, exact candidate bounds for explicit detail requests, minimum raw
entity-shape validation, exact raw response/source-metadata caching, stale
request protection, recoverable storage warnings, visible OSM attribution, and
no new dependency. Claude final audit returned `PASS WITH MINOR FIXES`. F-1
corrected exact 0.35-degree span handling at non-zero coordinates and added a
regression test. F-2 made error-state live announcements assertive and added a
429 accessibility assertion. Claude explicitly authorized Done after these
confined fixes without re-audit. Accepted CTC-019 hardening advisories are to
validate all cached source-metadata fields and pre-check already-aborted
signals; the deterministic trailing colon for an empty discovery-name cache key
requires no change. Verification passed after fixes: `npm run check` (scaffold
policy, build, 17 Vitest tests, and 12 route-isolated Playwright tests),
`git diff --check`, and
`npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh`
with 0 production vulnerabilities.

CTC-002 is Done - 2026-06-05. PR #1
(`ctc-002-app-scaffold`) completed after a workflow correction:
Gemini Deep Research completed specification review, then Claude completed
adversarial QA planning before Codex resumed implementation. Accepted
architecture is React 19.2.7, React DOM 19.2.7, TypeScript 6.0.3, Vite 8.0.16,
Vitest 4.1.8, Playwright 1.60.0, and axe-playwright 4.11.3 on Node 24 LTS.
Direct dependencies are exact-pinned, CI actions are SHA-pinned with read-only
contents permission, and tests enforce synthetic non-geographic fixture data,
runtime network isolation, responsive smoke coverage, and an axe oracle test.
Map/geometry algorithms, Overpass behavior, basemap tiles, persistence, PDF
behavior, API keys, and user data flows remain out of scope. The tracked SBOM
and existing ODbL Section 4.6 PDF source-export policy remain authoritative.
Commit `71da9ed` applies the planning revisions. Verification passed:
`npm ci`, `npm run check` (policy verification, build, 3 unit tests, and 4
Playwright tests), `git diff --check`, `git diff --check --cached`, and
`npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh`
with React/React DOM/Scheduler verified as MIT and 0 production
vulnerabilities. Claude final audit returned `PASS` with no blockers or minor
fixes and explicitly authorized immediate Done. Residual future-hardening notes
include broader Playwright browser coverage, safer local preview-server reuse,
and documenting the current Node-only Vitest environment.

CTC-015 is Done - 2026-06-05. Commit `0f07ac0` added the Overpass query
contract and a synthetic parser fixture so CTC-004 can implement reviewed
request behavior instead of inventing it in runtime code. Claude final audit
returned `PASS WITH MINOR FIXES`; F-1 through F-3 were applied, and F-4 was
accepted by moving synthetic IDs above 9,000,000,000. Claude stated CTC-015 may
be marked Done after these confined docs/fixture fixes without re-audit.
Verification passed: fixture JSON parse, `git diff --check`,
`git diff --check --cached`, and
`npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh`.

CTC-021 is Done - 2026-06-05. Commit `cd12021` enabled GitHub private
vulnerability reporting for `ajason13/chart-the-course` via the GitHub API,
added durable `AGENTS.md` repo instructions, and updated `SECURITY.md` to
record the enabled reporting path while preserving the v1.0 launch blocker to
set and verify a monitored security contact email. Commit `b68e4c0` moved the
task to final audit context. Claude final audit returned `PASS` with no
blockers and no minor fixes. Verification passed: `git diff --check` and
`npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh`.

CTC-013 is Done - 2026-06-05. Commit `1943d59` added
`docs/reference-project-reuse-policy.md` to settle reference-project reuse
boundaries before app scaffolding or data-pipeline work. Claude final audit
returned `PASS WITH MINOR FIXES`; the minor fix clarified that GitHub license
API 404 responses mean GitHub license detection found no recognizable license
file such as `LICENSE`, `COPYING`, or an equivalent root license file, not that
no license text could exist anywhere. Docs-only governance exception was used;
separate Gemini research and Claude QA planning were skipped because no runtime
code, dependency, provider integration, deployment behavior, or user data flow
changes were included. Verification passed: `git diff --check`,
`git diff --check --cached`, and
`npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh`.

CTC-003 is Done - 2026-06-05. Commit `2a23607` drafted the legal/trademark
disclaimer posture before public app scaffolding or course data pipeline work.
Claude final audit returned `PASS WITH MINOR FIXES`; commit `35d83e0` applied
MF-1 through MF-3, and Claude stated no re-audit was required if fixes remained
docs-only.

CTC-018 is Done - 2026-06-05. Claude final audit returned `PASS WITH MINOR
FIXES`; MF-1 through MF-4 were applied. This repository scaffold is
governance-first and intentionally contains no runtime app shell, map provider,
tile provider, PDF library, or production dependency yet.

## Source of Truth

- Original Chart the Course code uses Apache-2.0.
- CTC-001 is Done.
- CTC-016 is Done.
- CTC-017 is Done.
- Claude re-review verdict for the governance policy was `PASS WITH MINOR
  FIXES`, and the corrected snippets are accepted as source of truth.

## Governance Guardrails

Do not copy, modify, adapt, link, combine, incorporate, or distribute code from
`ace` because it is AGPL-3.0. Because Chart the Course is a network-delivered
browser app, incorporating AGPL-covered code can trigger AGPL Section 13
source-availability obligations for the combined or modified work.

`hacker-yardage` and `openyardage-web` are study-only unless license or
permission is verified. Do not copy source code, UI structure, query text,
generated assets, or distinctive expressive implementation from unlicensed
repositories.

Browser API request identity must not rely on custom `User-Agent`. Use app
origin/referrer where available plus Overpass QL identifying comments.

PDFs that contain OSM-derived maps must include the full URL:

```text
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

ODbL Section 4.6 source availability applies when PDFs are distributed or
shared. Raw GIS source export must ship with PDF export later.

CTC-018 selected the MVP tile strategy: use blank/vector-only rendering of
OSM-derived course geometry and user-authored yardage-book overlays, with no
third-party basemap tiles loaded by default. Deployed builds must not use the
OSM public tile CDN without explicit project approval.

OSM attribution remains required in UI and PDFs even without basemap tiles
because course geometry is OSM-derived. If basemap context becomes necessary,
the preferred fallback is self-hosted scoped PMTiles/Protomaps in
project-controlled storage. MapTiler or Stadia may be evaluated later only
after plan, attribution, billing, and PDF/print requirements are reviewed.

Detailed decision record: `docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`.

Governance workflow note: docs-only governance tasks may skip separate Gemini
research and separate Claude adversarial planning when no runtime code,
production dependency, provider integration, deployment behavior, or user data
flow changes. Codex must still check primary sources directly when current
external terms matter, record sources/check dates, and provide Claude Chat a
self-contained final audit prompt that includes changed file contents because
Claude Chat does not have filesystem or GitHub access by default. Detailed
workflow: `docs/governance-workflow.md`.

CTC-003 legal/trademark policy: public docs, app surfaces, sample fixtures, and
generated exports must state that Chart the Course is independent and
unaffiliated with commercial brands unless a relationship is expressly stated.
Avoid third-party brand names in product positioning unless nominative,
necessary, and reviewed by logged maintainer decision. Do not ship prepackaged
high-fidelity replicas of commercial golf courses, proprietary course maps,
commercial yardage-book artwork, or simulator course assets. Real-course
fixtures require logged review of data source, permissions or open-data basis,
attribution, brand/course-name risk, jurisdiction-specific concerns, and why a
real fixture is necessary. Generated artifacts with OSM-derived geometry must
include OSM attribution and the full copyright URL when links are not available.
Baseline disclaimer text and legal source monitoring are in
`docs/legal-disclaimers.md`.

CTC-013 reference-project reuse policy: GitHub license detection found no
recognizable license file for `hacker-yardage` or `openyardage-web`, so both are
inspiration-only unless a license or written permission is verified. Do not
copy, translate, adapt, fork, depend on, reuse assets/templates, reuse query
text, or reuse distinctive workflow/UI details from either project. `ace` is
AGPL-3.0 and may be used only as an architecture/prior-art reference unless
Chart the Course intentionally adopts an AGPL-compatible licensing posture in a
future logged maintainer decision. Detailed decision record:
`docs/reference-project-reuse-policy.md`.

CTC-015 Overpass query contract: course discovery and detail loading should use
bounded bbox-scoped Overpass QL with identifying comments, JSON output,
explicit timeout/maxsize settings, no default `out meta`, and local public
Overpass caching aligned to the 7-day TTL in `ATTRIBUTION.md` unless a CTC-004
exploration spike temporarily uses session storage before CTC-019 establishes
durable local persistence. The contract covers `leisure=golf_course`, core
`golf=*` course features,
water/tree/forest hazards where available, error handling for rate limits and
timeouts, and OSM/ODbL source metadata needed for later PDF source export.
Detailed design record: `docs/overpass-query-contract.md`. Initial synthetic
fixture: `fixtures/overpass/synthetic-golf-course.json`.

## Compliance Commands

Canonical npm compliance flow:

```bash
npm ci
npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm \
  --omit dev \
  --output-format JSON \
  --output-file sbom.json \
  --validate

# Pass 1 - allowlist
npx license-checker-rseidelsohn \
  --production \
  --excludePrivatePackages \
  --onlyAllow "MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC;OFL-1.1;CC0-1.0;Unlicense;0BSD"

# Pass 2 - denylist
npx license-checker-rseidelsohn \
  --production \
  --excludePrivatePackages \
  --failOn "GPL-2.0-only;GPL-3.0-only;AGPL-3.0;UNLICENSED"
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

Do not run `npm ci --omit=dev` before invoking a devDependency SBOM tool. Do not
use `--package-lock-only` in the authoritative SBOM command.

Local script:

```bash
npm run compliance
```

Implementation note: `license-checker-rseidelsohn` rejects `--onlyAllow` and
`--failOn` in the same invocation, so the compliance flow enforces the accepted
license policy as separate allowlist and denylist passes. The scripts also pass
`--excludePrivatePackages` because this scanner reports the unpublished private
root package as `UNLICENSED` even though `package.json` declares Apache-2.0 and
`LICENSE` is present.

## Security Disclosure

GitHub private vulnerability reporting is enabled for
`ajason13/chart-the-course`. Continue using it until a monitored security email
exists. Do not publish `security@chartthecourse.app` until verified.

## Next Work

- Complete CTC-006 implementation verification and final Claude audit before
  marking the task Done.
- Keep CTC-019 durable cache/request policy separate from CTC-006 rendering and
  measurement work.
- CTC-019 should validate every cached source-metadata field and pre-check
  already-aborted request signals as accepted CTC-004 audit hardening notes.
- Future test-harness hardening should evaluate Firefox/WebKit Playwright
  coverage, explicit local preview-server reuse behavior, and a documented
  transition path if DOM-focused Vitest tests are introduced.
- Define provider-review cadence when the first basemap provider is adopted.
- Upgrade `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm` to the 4.x series and pin
  `--spec-version 1.6` when the first production dependency lands.
- Future app scaffold tasks should add a selected web stack, runtime tests, and
  attribution checks enforcing the selected tile strategy.

# CTC-006 Claude adversarial QA-planning handoff

## Role and gate

Act as the adversarial QA planner for CTC-006, Render selected hole map with
measurement controls. Critically challenge the corrected specification baseline
before implementation. Claude Chat has no filesystem or GitHub access; this
bundle is self-contained.

CTC-006 is not yet approved for implementation. Return an
implementation-readiness verdict and required specification corrections. Do
not write implementation code, create new epics, or broaden scope.

## Acceptance criteria

- Selected hole renders with tee, fairway, green, hazards, and scale indicator.
- User can click two points and see yards/meters.
- Map remains usable on desktop and mobile widths.
- Geometry fixtures verify distance tolerance.

## Binding boundaries

- CTC-006 owns browser-side selected-hole vector rendering, scale indication,
  and two-point yards/meters measurement only.
- Consume the existing CTC-005 `NormalizationResult` contract without
  weakening, mutating, healing, simplifying, or spatially re-associating it.
- Use dependency-free native React SVG with a fixed logical viewBox,
  blank/vector-only rendering, no basemap/provider/API key, and visible OSM
  attribution.
- No pan/zoom, pin dragging/snapping, durable cache, refresh/backoff/failover,
  geocoding, localStorage preference, PDF/export, target markers, carry arcs,
  notes, persistence, or new production dependency.
- CTC-019 owns durable request/cache policy. CTC-007 owns target markers,
  carry arcs, and the local project model.
- Use only synthetic fixtures. No prohibited reference-project reuse.

## Gemini response disposition

Gemini produced one relevant response and one failed final revision. The
relevant response correctly selected dependency-free React SVG and geodesic
measurement but contained contract and algorithm errors. Codex corrected those
errors in the first embedded file. The final Gemini revision was rejected in
full after it abandoned SVG for Canvas and reintroduced prohibited behavior.
Treat the corrected review as the sole specification baseline.

## Required review questions

1. Is native React SVG with zero new dependencies sufficient and correctly
   bounded for every acceptance criterion?
2. Is integration with the existing `NormalizationResult` precise, especially
   stable selection identity, null geometry, warnings, and unassociated
   features?
3. Resolve exact deterministic projection rules: logical viewBox, padding,
   minimum display extent, inverse, bounds, pole behavior, and typed failures.
4. Resolve exact measurement rules: Earth radius, safeguards, rounding,
   tolerance, both-unit display, and nice-distance scale bar.
5. Resolve Pointer Events and keyboard behavior: blank-space measurement,
   clamping/rejection, logical steps, third-point restart, clear, hole changes,
   resize, focus, announcements, and mobile usability.
6. Are layer inclusion/order and non-color styling deterministic for point,
   line, and polygon geometries?
7. Define warning matching/display without inferred causality or suppression.
8. Does the synthetic fixture and Vitest/Playwright matrix prove all acceptance
   criteria while preserving network isolation and existing behavior?
9. Identify any remaining CTC-007, CTC-019, provider, persistence, PDF/export,
   dependency, hidden diagnostics, or logging leakage.

## Required verdict format

Return:

1. **Verdict:** exactly `READY`, `READY WITH REQUIRED SPEC CORRECTIONS`, or
   `NOT READY`.
2. **Blocking findings:** numbered, with failure scenario and correction.
3. **Accepted baseline decisions.**
4. **Required corrected decisions:** exact deterministic rules suitable for
   implementation.
5. **Adversarial test matrix:** input/action, expected visual/measurement/state
   result, accessibility assertion, and source-contract assertion.
6. **Rejected/deferred recommendations.**
7. **Implementation gate:** state whether CTC-006 may move to
   `3. In Development (ChatGPT)` after corrections are recorded.

Treat invented contracts, unassociated-feature rendering, fabricated geometry,

# CTC-006 Gemini specification critical review

Date: 2026-06-11

## Review verdict

Gemini's corrected response is relevant and useful, but it is not
implementation-ready as written. It correctly selected dependency-free native
React SVG, preserved geographic coordinates for measurement, proposed
latitude-aware projection, chose geodesic two-point distance, and covered
pointer, touch, keyboard, responsive, attribution, and synthetic-test concerns.

The response also contradicts the existing CTC-005 contract, invents types and
fixture shapes, renders unassociated features as selected-hole fallbacks,
proposes an incorrect antipodal failure rule, and leaves projection, scale-bar,
interaction, and accessibility behavior insufficiently precise. The accepted
and corrected decisions below are the specification baseline for Claude
adversarial QA planning. CTC-006 is not approved for implementation until
Claude challenges this baseline and required corrections are recorded.

## Accepted decisions

- Use native React SVG with zero new production dependencies.
- Keep projection and distance math in pure dependency-free TypeScript helpers
  separate from React interaction state.
- Preserve every CTC-005 `{ lat, lon }` coordinate unchanged; projected SVG
  coordinates are derived values only.
- Use a latitude-aware local projection for visual geometry and geodesic
  distance for measurement.
- Render deterministic SVG layer groups and keep the measurement overlay last.
- Keep OSM attribution visible whenever OSM-derived geometry is visible.
- Provide explicit pointer/touch and keyboard two-point measurement behavior,
  a clear action, responsive layout, and live announcements.
- Use only synthetic fixtures and retain Playwright network isolation and axe
  checks.
- Clear measurement when the selected hole changes. Preserve geographic
  measurement points when only the viewport size changes.
- Return deterministic diagnostics from pure math helpers or visible UI state;
  do not add logging side effects.

## Rejected or corrected Gemini decisions

- Reject the invented `NormalizedGolfCourse`, `sourceEvidence`,
  `holeNumber`, `routeGeometry`, feature `type`, and feature `nodes` contracts.
  The authoritative input is the existing `NormalizationResult`,
  `NormalizedHole`, `NormalizedFeature`, and `Geometry` types in
  `src/normalize.ts`.
- Reject passing a course plus selected array index into the map as the core
  contract. Selection identity must use the stable hole
  `source.sourceKey`; an index may change when normalized results change.
- Reject rendering any `unassociatedFeatures` in a selected-hole view. CTC-005
  deliberately preserves those features because association is unknown.
  Rendering them as selected-hole context implies unsupported association.
- Reject using unassociated features or invented fallback geometry when a hole
  route is null. A selected hole may render its own associated non-null feature
  geometry without a route; if it has no renderable route or associated
  geometry, show an empty state.
- Reject claims about a hole "relying on an unsupported relation." Warnings are
  result-level structured records and may not prove that relationship. Display
  the exact relevant normalization warnings without inventing causality.
- Reject throwing merely because latitude and longitude could plausibly be
  swapped. Both may be valid in their ranges. Named fields and runtime range
  validation prevent order mistakes; invalid coordinates produce a
  deterministic non-renderable result instead of crashing the app.
- Reject degree-based `±0.001` geometry padding. Projection may create a
  deterministic minimum display extent for point-only or one-axis geometry,
  but it must not mutate or imply source geometry.
- Reject fixed browser-pixel projection as the canonical model. Use a fixed
  logical SVG viewBox and `preserveAspectRatio`; CSS handles responsive display.
  Pointer coordinates must convert through SVG's current screen transform.
- Reject a Haversine rule that returns `null` for antipodal points. Clamp the
  computed `a` value to `[0, 1]`; valid antipodal coordinates have a valid
  distance. Invalid/non-finite coordinates return a typed failure.
- Reject a fixed 100-pixel scale bar derived from DOM pixels. Scale indication
  must be deterministic in logical SVG units and select a labeled "nice"
  ground distance that fits a bounded portion of the logical viewport.
- Reject `onTouchStart` as a separate primary interaction path. Use Pointer
  Events for mouse, pen, and touch, with keyboard behavior implemented
  separately. Avoid duplicate touch/click selection.
- Reject invisible production JSON diagnostics and test-only UI contracts as
  observability. Test exported pure helpers directly and expose user-relevant
  warnings, measurement state, and attribution visibly.
- Reject exact unreviewed colors and color-only distinctions. Styling must use
  existing CSS conventions, sufficient contrast, and non-color distinctions
  such as strokes/dashes where needed.
- Reject exact 10-pixel keyboard movement until the logical viewport and
  keyboard step contract are defined. Keyboard movement must be deterministic,
  bounded, visible, and usable at mobile and desktop display sizes.
- Reject the fabricated fixture and the claim that the proposed 0.0009-degree
  latitude delta must equal exactly 100.1 meters. Test expected distances
  against independently calculated bounded values with explicit tolerance.

## Corrected specification baseline

### Module and input boundary

Add a small pure geometry/rendering module, likely `src/map.ts`, with types and
functions for:

- collecting renderable coordinates from one `NormalizedHole`;
- producing a deterministic local projection and inverse projection;
- projecting point, line, and polygon geometry into logical SVG coordinates;
- calculating geodesic meters and formatting meters/yards;
- calculating a deterministic scale-bar model.

The React map component consumes:

```typescript
type HoleMapProps = {
  hole: NormalizedHole;
  warnings: NormalizationWarning[];
  source: SourceMetadata;
};
```

Exact component/file names remain reviewable by Claude. The selected hole is
identified outside the component by `hole.source.sourceKey`. The app calls
`normalizeGolfCourse(response, source)` only for successful detail responses,
retains the `NormalizationResult`, and offers deterministic hole selection.

### Selected-hole rendering eligibility

- A hole is selectable even when its number is null; label it using its number
  when present and stable source key otherwise.
- Render only the selected hole's non-null `route` and its own associated
  features with non-null geometry.
- Never render `NormalizationResult.unassociatedFeatures` in the selected-hole
  map.
- Include all supported `Geometry` variants: point, line, and polygon.
- If the selected hole has no route and no associated non-null feature
  geometry, render a visible non-renderable empty state and no SVG map.
- Display result-level normalization warnings without changing or inferring
  their meaning. Provide a useful selected-hole subset by matching
  `sourceKey`, `holeNumber`, or refs only where the warning itself supplies
  that evidence; keep the complete warning list available.

### Projection

- Use a fixed logical SVG viewBox, with exact dimensions and padding resolved
  by Claude. Responsive CSS scales the SVG while preserving aspect ratio.
- Collect the selected hole's renderable coordinates without mutation.
- Validate finite/in-range named `{ lat, lon }` coordinates defensively.
- Use a local equirectangular projection centered at the coordinate-bounds
  midpoint. Longitude delta is multiplied by cosine of center latitude; north
  remains visually up.
- Fit the projected bounds uniformly into the padded logical viewport and
  center unused space.
- Define a deterministic minimum projected extent for point-only or one-axis
  geometry. This is display-only and must not add or alter geographic
  coordinates.
- Return a typed failure for no valid coordinates, invalid viewport/padding,
  non-finite math, or a near-zero longitude cosine that cannot produce a
  reliable inverse.
- Projection and inverse projection must round-trip within an explicit
  tolerance and remain deterministic under repeated calls.
- Resizing the CSS display does not recompute geographic projection or clear
  measurement because the logical viewBox is stable.

### Layers

Render groups in this back-to-front order:

1. vegetation
2. generic-water
3. golf-water
4. rough
5. fairway
6. bunker
7. green
8. tee
9. route
10. measurement overlay

Within a feature-kind group, preserve the existing deterministic
`hole.features` source-key order. Geometry-specific SVG primitives must be
deterministic. Styling must distinguish feature classes sufficiently without
depending on color alone.

### Measurement

- Store selected measurement anchors as original geographic `Coordinate`
  values obtained by inverse-projecting logical SVG positions.
- Pointer and keyboard input must be clamped or rejected consistently at the
  logical viewport boundary; Claude must resolve the exact rule.
- Use Haversine distance with a single documented Earth-radius constant and
  exact international conversion `1 yard = 0.9144 meters`.
- Clamp Haversine `a` to `[0, 1]`. Identical valid points return zero. Invalid
  coordinates return a typed failure; antipodal coordinates remain valid.
- Display both yards and meters to satisfy the acceptance criterion. A unit
  toggle is unnecessary unless Claude finds the phrase requires switchable
  primary units; conservative default is one result showing both rounded
  whole-unit values.
- The scale bar uses the same projection/measurement contract. Choose a
  deterministic nice distance from a documented sequence and a bar length that
  fits a bounded fraction of the logical viewport. Label the represented
  ground distance, not raw pixels.

### Interaction and accessibility

- Use Pointer Events for mouse, pen, and touch. First activation sets anchor
  one, second sets anchor two, and a third starts a new measurement. A visible
  clear button resets both.
- Do not require hover/live tracking for acceptance; it may be omitted to keep
  the interaction deterministic and touch-equivalent.
- The SVG or its containing interaction surface is keyboard focusable. A
  visible bounded logical crosshair starts at the viewport center; arrow keys
  move it by a documented logical-unit step, Enter/Space select, and Escape
  clears.
- Prevent page scrolling only for handled map keys while the interaction
  surface has focus.
- Measurement points and line must remain visually distinguishable independent
  of color and have adequate touch visibility.
- Provide an accessible map name/description, visible instructions, visible
  result text showing both units, polite live announcements for completed
  actions, and clear focus styling.
- Keep visible attribution adjacent to every rendered map. The full copyright
  URL remains linked.
- Clear measurement on selected-hole identity change; retain it across CSS
  resize because anchors are geographic.

### Tests and fixture

- Prefer pure Vitest tests in `src/map.test.ts` for coordinate collection,
  projection/inverse round trips, north-up orientation, aspect fit, minimum
  extent, invalid input, all geometry variants, layer ordering, Haversine known
  values/tolerance, yards conversion, antipodal/identical cases, and nice scale
  selection.
- Extend or add an explicitly synthetic normalized/detail fixture that matches
  the actual CTC-005 types. Ensure at least one selectable hole has route, tee,
  fairway, green, bunker, golf-water, rough, generic-water, and vegetation
  associated by explicit strict ref if every layer must be tested. Do not
  spatially infer association.
- Add focused component tests only if the existing Vitest Node environment can
  support them without a new dependency; otherwise cover component behavior in
  Playwright.
- Extend the existing Playwright network-isolated flow to load synthetic detail,
  select a hole, verify deterministic layers/attribution/warnings, measure using
  pointer and keyboard, clear/restart, switch holes, and test mobile overflow,
  focus, live result text, and axe behavior.
- Keep existing search, raw diagnostics, cache behavior, and error-state tests
  passing. Do not introduce external requests.

## Remaining questions for Claude

1. Resolve exact logical viewBox dimensions, padding, and deterministic minimum
   projected extent without fabricating geographic geometry.
2. Resolve whether pointer/keyboard positions outside the inner rendered
   bounds are clamped or rejected, and whether measurement may target blank map
   space.
3. Resolve the exact keyboard logical-unit step and whether a modified larger
   step is needed.
4. Resolve the exact Earth-radius constant, display rounding, distance
   tolerance, and nice-scale sequence.
5. Resolve whether selected-hole warnings plus an expandable complete warning
   list are sufficient, and define warning matching without inferred
   causality.
6. Resolve whether associated generic-water and vegetation should be included
   in selected-hole bounds/rendering when explicit refs caused CTC-005 to
   associate them. Recommended default: yes.
7. Resolve whether the map component needs a provider-adapter placeholder now.
   Recommended default: no provider code until a provider is actually adopted.

## Claude QA-planning red lines

Treat these as blockers:

- any new production dependency, basemap/provider, network, cache, persistence,
  PDF/export, target-marker, carry-arc, or CTC-019 behavior;
- invented normalized types or fixture contracts that do not compile against
  `src/normalize.ts`;
- rendering or measuring unassociated features as selected-hole context;
- mutation, healing, simplification, or spatial inference over CTC-005
  geometry;
- measurement performed from SVG/pixel coordinates without inverse projection
  to geographic coordinates;
- swapped coordinate order, invalid/non-finite math, nondeterministic
  projection, or incorrect antipodal handling;
- hidden attribution, suppressed warnings, color-only semantics, inaccessible
  pointer-only interaction, or mobile overflow;
- hidden production test diagnostics or logging side effects;
- external network access or real-course fixtures in tests.

## Final Gemini revision disposition

Gemini received one final revision opportunity with 18 explicit mandatory
corrections and seven decisions to resolve. The final response was rejected in
full because it:

- abandoned native React SVG for layered Canvas/SVG/DOM rendering;
- reintroduced pan, zoom, pin dragging, snapping, multi-touch gestures,
  localStorage preferences, and out-of-bounds styling outside CTC-006;
- invented `RawGPSCoordinate`, normalized `[0,1]` types, and other contracts
  instead of using `src/normalize.ts`;
- prescribed console logging, Jest, Cypress, browser-pixel/DPR math, and
  unsupported sub-millisecond/sub-millimeter/60-FPS claims;
- failed to resolve the required fixed logical viewBox, deterministic minimum
  extent, warning matching, actual CTC-005 fixture contract, and bounded
  keyboard behavior.

No decisions from the final Gemini revision supersede this corrected baseline.
Proceed to Claude adversarial QA planning using this document as authority.

# CTC-006 final Gemini specification revision

Revise your prior CTC-006 specification one final time. Your response was
relevant, but it is not implementation-ready because several recommendations
contradict the supplied repository contracts.

Use the original self-contained
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-prompt.md` and the following
mandatory corrections. Return a complete replacement specification, not a
commentary or change summary.

## Mandatory corrections

1. Use only the actual existing contracts from `src/normalize.ts`:
   `NormalizationResult`, `NormalizedHole`, `NormalizedFeature`, `Geometry`,
   `NormalizationWarning`, `Coordinate`, and `SourceMetadata`. Do not invent
   `NormalizedGolfCourse`, `sourceEvidence`, `holeNumber`, `routeGeometry`,
   feature `type`, or feature `nodes`.
2. Identify selected holes by stable `hole.source.sourceKey`, not array index.
3. Never render or measure `NormalizationResult.unassociatedFeatures` as
   selected-hole context. Do not use them as null-route fallbacks or infer that
   they belong to a hole.
4. A selected hole renders only its own non-null route and associated non-null
   feature geometry. If none exists, show a non-renderable empty state.
5. Display exact normalization warnings without inventing causal claims such as
   a hole relying on an unsupported relation.
6. Use a fixed logical SVG viewBox with responsive CSS and
   `preserveAspectRatio`. Do not make browser pixels the canonical projection
   coordinate system.
7. Define a deterministic local equirectangular projection and inverse using
   named `{ lat, lon }` fields. Invalid coordinates return a typed failure;
   never claim valid-range coordinates can reliably be detected as swapped.
8. Define deterministic point-only and one-axis minimum display extents without
   mutating or fabricating geographic geometry.
9. Use Haversine measurement with a documented Earth-radius constant, clamp
   `a` to `[0, 1]`, treat valid antipodal points as valid, and use the exact
   international conversion `1 yard = 0.9144 meters`.
10. Display both yards and meters. Do not require a unit toggle unless you can
    prove it is required by the acceptance criteria.
11. Define a deterministic logical-SVG scale bar using a documented nice-
    distance sequence. Do not use a fixed 100 browser-pixel bar.
12. Use Pointer Events for mouse, pen, and touch to avoid duplicate touch/click
    selection. Define keyboard behavior separately.
13. Do not require hover/live tracking. Define deterministic two-point select,
    third-point restart, clear, selected-hole change, resize, focus, arrow-key,
    Enter/Space, and Escape behavior.
14. Do not add hidden production JSON diagnostics. Prefer exported pure helper
    tests and visible user-relevant warning/measurement state.
15. Do not prescribe unreviewed exact colors or color-only distinctions.
    Require adequate contrast and non-color distinctions such as strokes or
    dashes.
16. Define fixtures using the actual CTC-005 types. Do not fabricate exact
    distance expectations; use independently calculated expected values with
    explicit tolerances.
17. Keep existing discovery/detail, cache, diagnostics, error, network-
    isolation, attribution, and axe behavior passing.
18. Add no production dependency, provider, basemap, network/cache policy,
    persistence, PDF/export, target marker, carry arc, or CTC-019 behavior.

## Decisions you must resolve

Return exact recommended defaults for:

1. Logical SVG viewBox dimensions, padding, and minimum projected extent.
2. Whether measurement positions outside the inner rendered bounds are clamped
   or rejected, and whether blank map space is measurable.
3. Keyboard logical-unit step and optional modified larger step.
4. Earth-radius constant, display rounding, distance-test tolerance, and nice-
   scale sequence.
5. Warning matching/display behavior without inferred causality.
6. Whether explicitly ref-associated generic-water and vegetation are included
   in selected-hole rendering and bounds.
7. Whether a provider-adapter placeholder is needed now. Conservative default:
   no provider code until a provider is adopted.

## Required output

Return the complete implementation-ready CTC-006 specification using the
original prompt's 14-section response format. The first sentence must be:

`CTC-006 specifies browser-side selected-hole vector rendering and two-point
measurement only.`

Do not discuss the prior Redis response, AI-agent workflows, roadmaps, epics,
or unrelated tasks. Do not write implementation code.

# Tile Provider Strategy

Status: Selected for MVP on 2026-06-04 under CTC-018.

Chart the Course must choose a compliant base-map strategy before any deployed
map scaffold. The MVP must not depend on the OpenStreetMap public tile CDN for
deployed use, must keep attribution visible, and must leave room for a later
provider change without reshaping the yardage-book workflow.

## Decision

The selected MVP strategy is blank/vector-only rendering of OSM-derived course
geometry, user-authored target lines, yardage markers, hazards, notes, and
print/PDF overlays. The deployed MVP must not load third-party basemap tiles by
default.

Fallback path:

1. If users need geographic context beyond course geometry, self-host a scoped
   PMTiles/Protomaps basemap extract in project-controlled storage.
2. If operational burden is too high, evaluate MapTiler or Stadia under a paid
   or explicitly approved plan before enabling hosted basemap tiles.
3. If a provider's terms, attribution requirements, pricing, or service
   availability change materially, disable that provider in deployed builds
   until the policy is re-reviewed.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not use `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` or any other OSM
  public tile CDN endpoint in deployed Chart the Course builds without explicit
  project approval.
- Do not add prefetch, bulk-download, scraping, or offline tile caching features
  against public tile services unless the provider's plan and terms expressly
  allow them.
- Do not hide attribution behind app chrome, overlays, collapsed controls, or
  off-screen UI when a map or map-derived export is visible.
- Keep the tile provider configurable behind a provider adapter boundary when a
  map scaffold is introduced. Course geometry, yardage calculations, and PDF
  export must not assume a specific basemap vendor.

## Attribution Requirements

Even without third-party basemap tiles, Chart the Course uses OSM-derived course
geometry. OSM attribution remains required in UI views and PDFs that display or
export that geometry.

Required UI attribution for MVP geometry-only views:

```text
Course data © OpenStreetMap contributors
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

Required PDF attribution for MVP geometry-only exports:

```text
Course geometry and map data © OpenStreetMap contributors.
OpenStreetMap copyright and license: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

If a third-party basemap provider is enabled later, its attribution must appear
where the provider requires it:

- UI: visible on every map view using that provider, with links when the medium
  supports links.
- PDF/print: visible near the map, in a footer, citation, or acknowledgements
  block as permitted by the provider, including full URLs when links are not
  possible.
- Notices: listed in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with provider name, source data,
  plan or hosting mode, required attribution text, and verification date.

## Option Comparison

| Option | Fit | Attribution | Operational notes | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blank/vector-only MVP | Best for first deployed app. Supports hole layout, yardage planning, target lines, notes, and PDF output without basemap tiles. | OSM attribution still required for OSM-derived course geometry in UI and PDFs. No provider attribution required. | Lowest vendor, cost, API-key, and availability risk. Less surrounding geographic context. | Selected for MVP. |
| Self-hosted PMTiles/Protomaps | Strong fallback when surrounding context becomes necessary. | Protomaps basemap downloads are OSM-derived Produced Works, so OSM attribution is required. Also preserve any Protomaps/OpenMapTiles/style notices that apply to selected assets. | Requires storage, CDN/range-request support, update workflow, integrity checks, and scoped extracts to avoid large planet-file operations. | Preferred fallback. |
| MapTiler | Viable hosted provider after plan review. | MapTiler docs require visible MapTiler and OpenStreetMap attribution; free accounts also require a MapTiler logo. Printed/static media need comparable visible attribution. | Requires API key, plan limits, billing review, and provider-specific UI/PDF attribution checks. | Defer until basemap need is proven. |
| Stadia Maps | Viable hosted provider after plan review. | Stadia requires Stadia Maps, OpenMapTiles, and OpenStreetMap attribution for most styles; Stamen-origin styles require "Map tiles by Stamen Design" with `stamen.com` URL in print. Print must include required URLs such as `stadiamaps.com` and `openstreetmap.org/copyright`. | Requires API key/domain configuration, plan review, and style-specific notices. | Defer until basemap need is proven. |
| Thunderforest | Viable niche/activity-map provider, not a first choice for MVP. | Terms require Thunderforest and OpenStreetMap contributor attribution, with printed-media text using provider and OSM copyright URLs. | Registration and subscription model; no caching proxies or redistribution; more style-specific than needed for yardage-book MVP. | Not selected. |
| OpenFreeMap | Interesting free hosted vector option, not conservative enough for MVP. | OSM-derived attribution still applies; provider terms are broad, as-is, and may change. | Free as-is service with no availability warranty and discontinuation risk. Suitable for experiments, not project default. | Not selected for deployed MVP. |
| Esri basemaps | Mature commercial ecosystem, but excess scope for MVP. | Esri basemaps require Esri/source attribution depending on layer. | Terms, account requirements, SDK/provider coupling, and non-OSM data sources add policy complexity. | Not selected. |

## Source Notes

Research was checked against official provider or project pages on 2026-06-04:

- OpenStreetMap copyright and attribution guide: OSM data use requires credit
  and ODbL clarity; printed media should include the full copyright URL.
  <https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright/attribution-guide/>
- Protomaps basemap downloads: Protomaps basemap is OSM-derived, distributed as
  an ODbL Produced Work, and hotlinking downloads is discouraged in favor of
  copying to controlled cloud storage.

# CTC-006 Gemini Deep Research response correction

Discard the entire previous response. It replaces CTC-006 with an unapproved
Fastify/Redis geohash caching proxy and does not answer CTC-006.

Do not discuss or specify Fastify, Redis, geohashes, server proxies,
stale-while-revalidate, distributed locking, upstream aggregation, caching,
rate limiting, endpoint pools or failover, XML normalization, PostGIS, MCP,
OIDC, SPIRE, Kubernetes, KG-TRACES, PyTorch, DeepSpeed, enterprise
infrastructure, performance roadmaps, product-management methods, epics, user
stories, Notion schemas, AI-agent workflows, or modular coding-agent task
lists. These topics belong to CTC-019, unrelated future work, or no accepted
Chart the Course task.

The previous response contains no accepted CTC-006 specification decisions.
Public Overpass capacity and caching concerns do not affect this task because
CTC-006 receives an already loaded and normalized in-memory model.

Use the uploaded self-contained
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-prompt.md` as the sole
project-specific authority. Execute exactly this replacement plan:

1. Compare native SVG, Canvas, and DOM for the existing React app and select
   the narrow blank/vector-only renderer. Default to no new dependency.
2. Specify the detail-response to `normalizeGolfCourse` to selected-renderable-
   hole state flow, preserving CTC-005 warnings, null geometry, source
   evidence, and unassociated-feature boundaries.
3. Specify a pure deterministic WGS84 `{ lat, lon }` to local viewport
   projection with latitude-aware longitude scaling, padding, aspect fitting,
   resize behavior, coordinate-order safety, and degenerate-input handling.
4. Specify deterministic inclusion and layer order for hole route, tee,
   fairway, green, bunker, rough, golf-specific water, generic water, and
   vegetation without spatially associating unassociated features.
5. Specify truthful two-point distance in yards/meters, scale-indicator math,
   constants, rounding, tolerances, and test oracles.
6. Specify complete pointer, touch, keyboard, responsive, and accessibility
   behavior for selecting, replacing, clearing, and announcing measurement
   points.
7. Specify the exact synthetic fixture, Vitest, and Playwright matrix for
   projection, layer order, distance tolerance, scale truthfulness,
   interactions, mobile layout, attribution, diagnostics, network isolation,
   and axe checks.
8. Return only the implementation-ready CTC-006 technical specification using
   the 14-section response format required by the uploaded prompt.

Do not propose another plan, ask for further plan changes, write full
implementation code, invent dependencies or server components, provide a
roadmap, or broaden scope. The first sentence of the response must be:

`CTC-006 specifies browser-side selected-hole vector rendering and two-point
measurement only.`

Start this replacement plan and return only the CTC-006 specification.

# CTC-006: Specify selected-hole vector rendering and measurement controls

## Research target

Act as the specification architect for CTC-006, Render selected hole map with
measurement controls. Produce an implementation-ready technical specification
for critical review. Do not write full implementation code.

Gemini has no filesystem or GitHub access. This bundle is self-contained. Base
all project-specific decisions on the exact repository contents embedded below.
Use current primary sources only where necessary for projection, geodesic
distance, SVG/Canvas/browser interaction, or accessibility facts. Clearly
separate sourced facts from project design recommendations.

## Current project and gate state

- Repository: Chart the Course, Apache-2.0 browser app using React, TypeScript,
  Vite, Vitest, and Playwright.
- Current repository state: clean synchronized `main` at commit
  `3449748c84495097abd7ba2cdee52488dfbfd9ef`.
- CTC-006 is `1. Spec Drafting (Gemini)`.
- CTC-005 is Done and supplies the pure normalized geometry model in
  `src/normalize.ts`.
- CTC-018 selected blank/vector-only rendering of OSM-derived geometry with no
  third-party basemap tiles by default.
- CTC-019 remains independent durable Overpass cache/request-identity work.
- No feature branch or runtime implementation may begin until this
  specification is critically reviewed and Claude adversarial QA planning is
  completed and critically reviewed.

## Acceptance criteria

- Selected hole renders with tee, fairway, green, hazards, and scale indicator.
- User can click two points and see yards/meters.
- Map remains usable on desktop and mobile widths.
- Geometry fixtures verify distance tolerance.

## Binding scope boundaries

CTC-006 owns selected-hole geometry rendering, visible scale indication, and
two-point yards/meters measurement only.

- Use the CTC-005 normalized model as input. Do not weaken, bypass, mutate, or
  reinterpret its strict `{ lat, lon }` geometry, warnings, source evidence,
  unsupported-relation decisions, or unassociated-feature decisions.
- Follow `docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`: blank/vector-only MVP, no public OSM
  tile CDN, no third-party basemap/provider/API key, and visible OSM
  attribution on every OSM-derived geometry view.
- Prefer native React, TypeScript, SVG, Canvas, or DOM using existing
  dependencies. Any new rendering or geospatial dependency requires an
  explicit reviewed justification and remains unapproved by default.
- Do not add durable cache, refresh controls, Retry-After/backoff, endpoint
  failover, geocoding, PDF/export behavior, target markers, carry arcs, notes,
  or local project persistence.
- CTC-019 owns durable Overpass request/cache policy.
- CTC-007 owns target markers, carry arcs, and the local project model.
- Use only explicitly synthetic invented fixtures. Do not propose real-course
  fixtures without governance review.
- Do not copy or adapt code, query text, UI structures, or assets from
  prohibited or unlicensed reference projects.

## Mandatory planning questions

Resolve each question explicitly:

1. Select the narrow rendering architecture for the blank/vector-only MVP.
   Compare native SVG, Canvas, and DOM against the existing React scaffold and
   recommend one. State whether a new dependency is needed; default to none.
2. Define how the app transitions from a successful detail response through
   `normalizeGolfCourse` to selection of one renderable normalized hole.
   Specify behavior for zero/multiple course candidates, no holes, null route
   geometry, missing tee/green warnings, unsupported relations, and
   unassociated features without hiding CTC-005 diagnostics.
3. Define a pure deterministic WGS84 `{ lat, lon }` to local viewport
   projection contract. Include bounds source, padding, aspect-ratio fitting,
   latitude-aware longitude scaling, degenerate bounds, coordinate-order
   safety, numeric validation, and resizing. Do not mutate source geometry.
4. Define deterministic rendering inclusion and layer order for route, tee,
   fairway, green, bunker, rough, golf-specific water, generic water, and
   vegetation. Explain whether and how unassociated features may appear when a
   selected-hole view cannot spatially infer association.
5. Define two-point measurement math and units. Compare an appropriate
   geodesic formula with local planar distance for the bounded course scale,
   select one, specify Earth-radius/unit constants, yards/meters rounding,
   accuracy/tolerance tests, antipodal/numeric edge cases, and coordinate-order
   protections.
6. Define scale-indicator behavior so it remains truthful under projection,
   viewport resizing, and latitude variation. State its calculation,
   placement, labeling, and test oracle.
7. Define interaction state and behavior for mouse/pointer, touch, and keyboard
   users: starting, completing, replacing, clearing, focus, hit targets,
   announcements, visible markers/line, and behavior during hole changes or
   resize.
8. Define responsive desktop/mobile behavior, minimum useful viewport,
   overflow/zoom policy if any, and accessibility requirements. Address SVG or
   Canvas semantics, keyboard operability, color independence, contrast,
   motion, and screen-reader output.
9. Define exact synthetic fixture changes and the Vitest/Playwright test
   matrix. Include projection determinism, layer inclusion/order, distance
   tolerance, scale truthfulness, pointer/touch/keyboard behavior, responsive
   layout, attribution, warning/error states, network isolation, and axe scans.
10. Define observability/debugging for projection, selection, and measurement.
    Prefer deterministic returned diagnostics or visible states over logging
    side effects.
11. Define exact likely files to add/change and ownership boundaries. Keep the
    implementation small and avoid unrelated refactors.
12. Identify narrow unresolved maintainer decisions, with a recommended
    conservative default for each.

## Decisions that must not be silently invented

- Do not assume every normalized hole is renderable.
- Do not spatially associate unassociated features to a hole inside CTC-006
  unless the specification explicitly justifies a deterministic, reviewed
  ownership change; conservative default is not to infer.
- Do not heal, auto-close, simplify, or otherwise alter CTC-005 source
  geometry.
- Do not treat local placeholder coordinates from `fixtures/courses` as WGS84.
- Do not add pan/zoom, a basemap, map-provider adapters, export, or persistence
  merely because a map library supports them.
- Do not let a visual SVG/Canvas coordinate be mistaken for geographic
  coordinates when computing measurement.
- Do not hide OSM attribution or normalization warnings.

## Required response format

Return a self-contained specification with these sections:

1. Verdict on scope/readiness and blocking unresolved decisions.
2. Accepted assumptions and explicitly rejected/deferred assumptions.
3. Recommended rendering architecture and dependency decision.
4. Proposed module/type/API boundaries, with representative declarations or
   pseudocode but no full implementation.
5. Detail-response normalization and selected-hole state flow.
6. Projection algorithm, viewport fitting, resize behavior, and failure modes.
7. Deterministic layer inclusion/order/style semantics.
8. Measurement algorithm, constants, units, rounding, tolerance, and scale
   indicator.
9. Pointer, touch, keyboard, responsive, and accessibility behavior.
10. Warning/error/empty-state behavior and observability decision.
11. Synthetic fixture and Vitest/Playwright test matrix with exact or bounded
    expected results.
12. File/change plan and non-goals.
13. Adversarial QA red lines for the later Claude planning handoff.
14. Open maintainer decisions, if any, with recommended defaults.

## Completion test

The response is acceptable only if it:

1. Chooses a narrow renderer and states an explicit dependency decision.
2. Defines a deterministic projection that preserves CTC-005 geometry.
3. Defines truthful distance and scale calculations with test tolerances.
4. Defines complete pointer, touch, keyboard, mobile, and accessibility
   behavior.
5. Defines exact synthetic test coverage and preserves visible OSM attribution.
6. Keeps CTC-007, CTC-019, basemaps/providers, PDF/export, and persistence out
   of scope.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains the initial Chart the Course browser app scaffold plus governance docs. Runtime source lives in `src/`, Playwright smoke tests live in `test/e2e/`, and deterministic fixtures live in `fixtures/`. Root documents define project policy and status: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ATTRIBUTION.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and `LICENSE`. Focused decision records live in `docs/`, including tile-provider, governance-workflow, legal-disclaimer, reference-reuse, and Overpass-contract guidance. Automation lives in `scripts/`; `scripts/compliance.sh` delegates to the canonical npm compliance flow. Dependency metadata is tracked in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and generated `sbom.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm ci`: install dependencies from the lockfile.
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite app on `127.0.0.1`.
- `npm run verify:scaffold`: enforce exact direct dependency pins, Node 24,
  React bootstrap, and SHA-pinned/read-only CI policy.
- `npm run build`: type-check and build the browser app.
- `npm run test:unit`: run Vitest unit tests.
- `npm run test:e2e`: run Playwright smoke tests against the local preview server.
- `npm run check`: run app build, unit tests, and Playwright smoke tests.
- `npm run generate:sbom`: regenerate `sbom.json` with CycloneDX.
- `npm run license:check`: run production dependency allowlist and denylist checks.
- `npm run audit:prod`: run `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`.
- `npm run compliance`: run SBOM generation, license checks, and production audit.
- `scripts/compliance.sh`: shell wrapper for the same compliance flow.
- `git diff --check`: catch whitespace errors before review.

The current React app shell is intentionally local-first and fixture-backed.
Use Node 24 LTS and npm 11 as declared in `.nvmrc` and `package.json`. Keep
direct dependencies exact-pinned. Do not add Overpass runtime calls, map
providers, basemap tiles, PDF export behavior, additional production
dependencies, API keys, or user data flows unless the selected task explicitly
covers them and governance docs are updated.

## Agent Workflow

Before starting a task, run `git status --short --branch`, read `CONTEXT.md`,
and fetch the current Notion task. Notion is long-term memory; `CONTEXT.md` is
active repo memory. Move active Codex work to `3. In Development (ChatGPT)`,
then to `4. Final Audit (Claude)` for review, and only mark `5. Done` after
Claude findings are resolved or explicitly accepted. For docs-only governance
tasks, the Gemini/Claude planning handoff may be skipped only under
`docs/governance-workflow.md`; final Claude audit is still required.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Keep Markdown concise, source-linked where policy depends on external terms, and specific to Chart the Course. Use sentence-case prose, fenced command examples, and relative paths such as `docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`. Shell scripts should use POSIX `sh` unless a stronger shell is required; keep `set -eu` for fail-fast behavior. Package scripts should remain explicit and composable.

## Testing Guidelines

Unit tests use Vitest and should sit next to the source as `*.test.ts`. Browser smoke tests use Playwright under `test/e2e/`. For current changes, run `npm run check`, `git diff --check`, and `npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/chart-the-course-npm-cache scripts/compliance.sh` before review.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use short imperative subjects, often referencing CTC task IDs, for example `Document CTC-018 tile provider strategy` and `Resolve CTC-003 audit minor fixes`. Keep commits focused on one task. Pull requests should include a brief summary, verification commands and results, linked task or issue, governance impact, and screenshots only when UI changes exist.

## Security & Governance Notes

Do not copy or adapt AGPL-3.0 code from `ace`. Treat `hacker-yardage` and `openyardage-web` as study-only unless permissions are verified. Do not add map providers, production dependencies, API keys, PDF export behavior, or user data flows without updating the relevant docs and compliance posture. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting until a monitored security email exists.

# Tile Provider Strategy

Status: Selected for MVP on 2026-06-04 under CTC-018.

Chart the Course must choose a compliant base-map strategy before any deployed
map scaffold. The MVP must not depend on the OpenStreetMap public tile CDN for
deployed use, must keep attribution visible, and must leave room for a later
provider change without reshaping the yardage-book workflow.

## Decision

The selected MVP strategy is blank/vector-only rendering of OSM-derived course
geometry, user-authored target lines, yardage markers, hazards, notes, and
print/PDF overlays. The deployed MVP must not load third-party basemap tiles by
default.

Fallback path:

1. If users need geographic context beyond course geometry, self-host a scoped
   PMTiles/Protomaps basemap extract in project-controlled storage.
2. If operational burden is too high, evaluate MapTiler or Stadia under a paid
   or explicitly approved plan before enabling hosted basemap tiles.
3. If a provider's terms, attribution requirements, pricing, or service
   availability change materially, disable that provider in deployed builds
   until the policy is re-reviewed.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not use `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` or any other OSM
  public tile CDN endpoint in deployed Chart the Course builds without explicit
  project approval.
- Do not add prefetch, bulk-download, scraping, or offline tile caching features
  against public tile services unless the provider's plan and terms expressly
  allow them.
- Do not hide attribution behind app chrome, overlays, collapsed controls, or
  off-screen UI when a map or map-derived export is visible.
- Keep the tile provider configurable behind a provider adapter boundary when a
  map scaffold is introduced. Course geometry, yardage calculations, and PDF
  export must not assume a specific basemap vendor.

## Attribution Requirements

Even without third-party basemap tiles, Chart the Course uses OSM-derived course
geometry. OSM attribution remains required in UI views and PDFs that display or
export that geometry.

Required UI attribution for MVP geometry-only views:

```text
Course data © OpenStreetMap contributors
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

Required PDF attribution for MVP geometry-only exports:

```text
Course geometry and map data © OpenStreetMap contributors.
OpenStreetMap copyright and license: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
```

If a third-party basemap provider is enabled later, its attribution must appear
where the provider requires it:

- UI: visible on every map view using that provider, with links when the medium
  supports links.
- PDF/print: visible near the map, in a footer, citation, or acknowledgements
  block as permitted by the provider, including full URLs when links are not
  possible.
- Notices: listed in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with provider name, source data,
  plan or hosting mode, required attribution text, and verification date.

## Option Comparison

| Option | Fit | Attribution | Operational notes | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blank/vector-only MVP | Best for first deployed app. Supports hole layout, yardage planning, target lines, notes, and PDF output without basemap tiles. | OSM attribution still required for OSM-derived course geometry in UI and PDFs. No provider attribution required. | Lowest vendor, cost, API-key, and availability risk. Less surrounding geographic context. | Selected for MVP. |
| Self-hosted PMTiles/Protomaps | Strong fallback when surrounding context becomes necessary. | Protomaps basemap downloads are OSM-derived Produced Works, so OSM attribution is required. Also preserve any Protomaps/OpenMapTiles/style notices that apply to selected assets. | Requires storage, CDN/range-request support, update workflow, integrity checks, and scoped extracts to avoid large planet-file operations. | Preferred fallback. |
| MapTiler | Viable hosted provider after plan review. | MapTiler docs require visible MapTiler and OpenStreetMap attribution; free accounts also require a MapTiler logo. Printed/static media need comparable visible attribution. | Requires API key, plan limits, billing review, and provider-specific UI/PDF attribution checks. | Defer until basemap need is proven. |
| Stadia Maps | Viable hosted provider after plan review. | Stadia requires Stadia Maps, OpenMapTiles, and OpenStreetMap attribution for most styles; Stamen-origin styles require "Map tiles by Stamen Design" with `stamen.com` URL in print. Print must include required URLs such as `stadiamaps.com` and `openstreetmap.org/copyright`. | Requires API key/domain configuration, plan review, and style-specific notices. | Defer until basemap need is proven. |
| Thunderforest | Viable niche/activity-map provider, not a first choice for MVP. | Terms require Thunderforest and OpenStreetMap contributor attribution, with printed-media text using provider and OSM copyright URLs. | Registration and subscription model; no caching proxies or redistribution; more style-specific than needed for yardage-book MVP. | Not selected. |
| OpenFreeMap | Interesting free hosted vector option, not conservative enough for MVP. | OSM-derived attribution still applies; provider terms are broad, as-is, and may change. | Free as-is service with no availability warranty and discontinuation risk. Suitable for experiments, not project default. | Not selected for deployed MVP. |
| Esri basemaps | Mature commercial ecosystem, but excess scope for MVP. | Esri basemaps require Esri/source attribution depending on layer. | Terms, account requirements, SDK/provider coupling, and non-OSM data sources add policy complexity. | Not selected. |

# Overpass Query Contract

Status: Implemented as a bounded CTC-004 browser spike on 2026-06-06.

This contract defines the first Chart the Course Overpass API request shape for
course discovery and course-detail loading. CTC-004 implements the bounded
session-only browser spike; later durable cache and geometry work remain
separate tasks.

## Goals

- Find candidate golf courses inside a user-selected bounding box.
- Load the selected course boundary and golf-course features needed for a
  blank/vector-only MVP map.
- Keep public Overpass usage bounded, cacheable, attributable, and recoverable
  when the service rate-limits or sheds load.
- Preserve raw OSM entity IDs, tags, geometry, query text, bounding box, source
  URL, and source-check metadata for later ODbL source export.

## Inputs

All coordinates use WGS84 decimal degrees in Overpass order:
`south,west,north,east`.

| Field | Required | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bbox` | Yes | User-selected or geocoded search extent. The client must reject global, country-scale, or otherwise unbounded boxes. |
| `courseName` | No | User-entered search text. Escape for Overpass regular-expression syntax before interpolation. |
| `selectedCourseBbox` | Yes for detail | Exact valid bounding box from the selected `leisure=golf_course` result. Bbox padding is deferred beyond CTC-004. |
| `appVersion` | Yes | Used in the identifying Overpass QL comment. |
| `contactUrl` | Yes | Public project or support URL in the identifying Overpass QL comment. |

Initial guardrail: accept only manually entered decimal coordinate syntax with
at most seven decimal places. Reject exponent notation, locale commas,
non-finite values, antimeridian crossing, invalid ordering, and bboxes wider
than 0.35 degrees longitude or 0.35 degrees latitude unless a future maintainer
decision records a different limit. Exactly 0.35 degrees is allowed. This keeps
browser requests scoped to a city/neighborhood-scale search instead of using
public Overpass as a bulk data backend.

`courseName` must be trimmed, limited to 200 Unicode code points, and rejected
if it contains ASCII control characters. Treat it as a literal string with a
single-pass encoder before interpolation into the regex filter: prefix `\`
before `"`, `\`, and each of `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`,
`}`, `|`, `^`, and `$`. Treat `*/` in a course name as ordinary quoted-string
content; it cannot terminate the separate leading comment. Do not concatenate
raw user input into Overpass QL.

## Request Identity

Browser JavaScript cannot reliably set a custom upstream `User-Agent`. Every
Overpass QL body must start with a project-identifying comment, and deployed
browser requests should allow the normal app origin/referrer to be sent where
browser policy permits it.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-mvp */
```

If Chart the Course later uses a proxy, self-hosted Overpass, or commercial
provider, that server-side layer should also set a descriptive upstream
`User-Agent`.

For CTC-004, the app version and contact URL are fixed trusted constants from
`package.json` and the GitHub repository URL. Validate both constants before
query construction and reject control characters or `*/`.

## Course Discovery Query

Use this query to find candidate courses within the search bbox. If
`courseName` is empty, omit the first name-filtered block and keep only the
unfiltered `leisure=golf_course` block.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-discovery */
[out:json][timeout:25][maxsize:536870912];
(
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]["name"~"{{escapedCourseName}}",i]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
);
out tags center bb;
```

Expected use:

- Show candidates from `leisure=golf_course` elements only.
- Prefer area or relation results when duplicate node/way/relation records
  describe the same facility.
- Preserve `id`, `type`, `tags.name`, `tags.operator`, `tags.website`,
  `bounds`, and `center` when present.
- Do not request `meta` for the MVP query path; parser tests can use static
  fixtures for metadata-specific cases if needed later.

## Course Detail Query

Use this query after the user selects a course. The bbox must be derived from
the selected course boundary when available, not from a full city or region.

```overpassql
/* chart-the-course/{{appVersion}} contact:{{contactUrl}} purpose:golf-course-detail */
[out:json][timeout:45][maxsize:536870912];
(
  nwr["leisure"="golf_course"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["golf"~"^(hole|fairway|green|bunker|tee|water_hazard|lateral_water_hazard|rough|out_of_bounds|pin|cartpath)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["natural"~"^(water|wood|tree|tree_row|scrub)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["landuse"~"^(forest|reservoir|basin)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["water"~"^(pond|lake|basin|reservoir)$"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
  nwr["waterway"]({{south}},{{west}},{{north}},{{east}});
);
out body geom;
```

Required feature handling:

- `leisure=golf_course`: course boundary, candidate facility metadata, and
  source bbox.
- `golf=hole`: hole routing line. Treat as the preferred hole-order source
  when `ref`, `name`, or relation membership is usable.
- `golf=fairway`, `golf=green`, `golf=bunker`, `golf=tee`: primary yardage-book
  geometry layers.
- `golf=water_hazard`, `golf=lateral_water_hazard`, `natural=water`,
  `water=*`, and `waterway=*`: candidate penalty/water hazard layers. The
  parser must keep original tags so later UI can distinguish golf-specific
  hazards from generic mapped water.
- `natural=wood`, `landuse=forest`, `natural=tree`, `natural=tree_row`,
  `natural=scrub`: candidate tree/vegetation hazards where available. These are
  advisory map layers, not proof of playable obstruction.

## Rate-Limit and Error Behavior

The public Overpass instances are shared infrastructure. Chart the Course must
treat them as a constrained public service, not a guaranteed production backend.

- Submit at most one active Overpass request per browser session.
- Cache successful public Overpass responses locally. The durable public
  Overpass cache target remains the 7-day TTL in `ATTRIBUTION.md`; if CTC-004
  ships before durable local persistence exists, session storage is acceptable
  only as a temporary CTC-004 exploration-spike constraint before CTC-019
  establishes durable local persistence.
- CTC-004 cache keys are
  `ctc:overpass:v1:discovery:{bbox}:{encoded-lowercase-name}` and
  `ctc:overpass:v1:detail:{bbox}`.
- Never query on keystrokes; require an explicit search action.
- On HTTP `429`, show a rate-limit state and back off before retrying. Do not
  retry automatically in a tight loop.
- On HTTP `504` or timeout, show a scoped-search prompt asking the user to
  narrow the area or try again later.
- On empty results, preserve the searched bbox and query text in diagnostics so
  future support can distinguish missing OSM data from parser failures.
- Keep request bodies small and avoid `out meta` in the default UI path.
- If expected traffic exceeds public Overpass safety guidance, switch to a
  self-hosted instance or approved provider before broad deployment.

A minimally valid raw response is an object with an `elements` array. Every
element must be an object with `type` equal to `node`, `way`, or `relation` and
an integer `id`. `elements: []` is an empty discovery or detail response. Any
non-empty valid elements array is success, even when expected feature types are
absent.

## Attribution and ODbL Records

Every successful detail response must be retained with enough source metadata
to support later ODbL source availability for PDFs and other generated outputs.

CTC-004 stores the exact response text plus source metadata in `sessionStorage`
and parses a separate in-memory representation for display. This session cache
does not satisfy later ODbL source-export obligations.

Persist or export alongside normalized geometry:

- Raw Overpass JSON response.
- Exact Overpass QL query body.
- Request URL or endpoint host.
- Request timestamp.
- Bbox values.
- OSM element type and ID for every normalized feature.
- Original tags for every normalized feature.
- OpenStreetMap copyright URL:
  `https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright`.

UI and PDF attribution rules remain governed by `ATTRIBUTION.md` and
`docs/tile-provider-strategy.md`.

## Mock Fixture

`fixtures/overpass/synthetic-golf-course.json` is the initial parser-test
fixture for this contract. It is deliberately synthetic: coordinates, names,
and IDs are invented and do not represent a real golf course.

Future parser tests should assert that the fixture can produce:

- One course boundary.
- One numbered hole line.
- Tee, fairway, green, bunker, golf-specific water hazard, generic water, and
  vegetation feature layers.
- OSM IDs, source tags, bbox, and query metadata preserved in the normalized
  model.

## Source Notes

Primary sources checked on 2026-06-05:

# CTC-005 Gemini specification critical review

Date: 2026-06-07

## Review verdict

Gemini's response is useful as adversarial input but is not implementation-ready
as written. It identified relevant OSM/Overpass variability and the need for a
pure deterministic normalization boundary, source references, unassociated
features, and stable warnings. It also materially broadened scope and proposed
unsupported destructive inference.

The accepted and corrected decisions below are the specification baseline for
Claude adversarial QA planning. Claude must challenge them before CTC-005 can
move to implementation.

## Accepted decisions

- Implement CTC-005 as a pure deterministic transformation from the existing
  validated `OverpassResponse` plus `SourceMetadata` into a normalized model.
- Index the complete flat element array before classification; never depend on
  raw Overpass element order.
- Preserve original OSM element type, integer ID, original tags, source
  metadata, and raw geometry evidence needed for attribution/debugging.
- Represent features that cannot be deterministically associated with a hole
  as top-level unassociated features.
- Omit a classified feature from normalized geometry when required coordinates
  are missing or malformed, while preserving a source reference in a stable
  warning.
- Do not invent missing relation segments or stitch incomplete rings.
- Return deterministic structured warnings rather than logging side effects.
- Use only synthetic fixtures and Vitest unit tests for CTC-005.

## Rejected decisions

- Reject Turf.js, MapLibre GL JS, or any new dependency. Neither library exists
  in the repository, and rendering/spatial math adoption is outside CTC-005.
- Reject rendering priorities, z-indexes, visual occlusion rules, map behavior,
  PDF behavior, and parser-owned attribution display strings.
- Reject convex-hull fallback boundaries, area calculations, centroids,
  containment tests, nearest-neighbor association, the arbitrary 150-meter
  threshold, or any other computational spatial inference.
- Reject automatically closing open ways, discarding unresolved node
  references, healing truncated geometry, or treating partial relation members
  as independent polygons. These actions fabricate or destructively reinterpret
  source geometry.
- Reject multipolygon assembly and general relation geometry normalization in
  CTC-005. Unsupported relations must remain attributable through warnings and
  preserved source references.
- Reject choosing course boundaries or greens by largest area or number of
  intersecting features.
- Reject stripping non-numeric characters from hole refs. Values such as `9B`
  and `Hole 9` are not equivalent to the strict numeric ref `9`.
- Reject merging distinct `golf=hole` source entities that share a hole number.
  Preserve each source entity and report ambiguous ordering/conflict.
- Reject legacy cart-path translation, generic grass/heath expansion, dogleg
  semantics, pin/green spatial merging, and alternative-green inference.
- Reject real-course fixture names and coordinates. Fixtures must remain
  explicitly synthetic and invented.
- Reject splitting CTC-005 into new epics/user stories or unrelated roadmap
  tasks.

## Corrected specification baseline

### Pure API boundary

The likely public API is conceptually:

```typescript
normalizeGolfCourse(
  response: OverpassResponse,
  source: SourceMetadata,
): NormalizationResult
```

The function must not fetch, mutate input, access storage, log, render, or
perform provider/cache policy. `NormalizationResult` must preserve source
metadata and contain normalized course data plus a deterministically sorted
warning array. Exact type names remain reviewable by Claude, but all
collection-valued fields must be arrays, not the singular fields shown in
Gemini's malformed model.

### Raw validation boundary

`validateResponse` guarantees only:

- the response is an object with an `elements` array;
- every element is an object with `type` equal to `node`, `way`, or `relation`;
- every element has an integer `id`.

The normalizer must safely validate all tags and geometry fields it consumes.
It must not assume tags are strings, coordinates are finite/in-range, way
geometry aligns with `nodes`, or relation members are complete.

### Geometry support

- Node: support a point only when `lat` and `lon` are finite and within WGS84
  latitude/longitude ranges.
- Way: support a line only when every geometry coordinate is valid and at least
  two coordinates exist.
- Closed way: support a polygon only when every coordinate is valid, at least
  four coordinates exist, and first and last coordinates are exactly equal.
- Open or malformed area-classified ways: do not auto-close or downgrade into a
  misleading normalized area; omit normalized geometry and warn.
- Relation: preserve source identity/tags but do not normalize relation geometry
  or assemble multipolygons in CTC-005; emit an unsupported-relation warning
  when the relation classifies as a relevant feature/course.
- Preserve raw node-reference IDs and raw geometry coordinates from supported
  source entities as source evidence; do not silently discard mismatches.

Use named `{ lat, lon }` coordinates to prevent accidental GeoJSON `[lon, lat]`
confusion unless Claude identifies a downstream reason to choose differently.

### Classification

Classification is based only on exact consumed tag strings from the reviewed
CTC-015 detail query:

- course boundary: `leisure=golf_course`
- hole route/metadata: `golf=hole`
- primary features: `golf=tee|green|fairway|bunker|rough`
- golf-specific water:
  `golf=water_hazard|lateral_water_hazard`
- generic water: relevant `natural=water`, `water=*`, `waterway=*`, and
  `landuse=reservoir|basin`
- vegetation: relevant
  `natural=wood|tree|tree_row|scrub` and `landuse=forest`

Preserve golf-specific water versus generic water and the original
classification tags. Each relevant entity receives exactly one classification
using this precedence from highest to lowest:

1. `golf=hole`
2. `golf=tee|green|fairway|bunker|rough`
3. `golf=water_hazard|lateral_water_hazard`
4. `leisure=golf_course`
5. generic water: relevant `natural=water`, `waterway=*`, `water=*`, and
   `landuse=reservoir|basin`
6. vegetation: relevant `natural=wood|tree|tree_row|scrub` and
   `landuse=forest`

Record the winning exact tag pair as `classifiedBy` and preserve every original
tag. Unknown/non-relevant entities, including queried
`golf=out_of_bounds|pin|cartpath`, are ignored silently.

### Course and hole rules

- A stable source key is `${type}/${id}`.
- Do not deduplicate entities solely by numeric ID because IDs are scoped by
  OSM entity type.
- Any repeated source key is a conflict and emits one `DUPLICATE_SOURCE_KEY`
  warning. Select a deterministic winner by comparing a canonical structural
  serialization of the complete records lexicographically; do not use
  first-seen order because normalized output must remain invariant when input
  elements are shuffled. Preserve all conflicting source refs in the warning.
- Recognize a hole number only when a string `ref`, after trimming, matches
  `/^[1-9][0-9]*$/` exactly. Leading zeros, signs, embedded spaces, decimal
  points, and non-digit characters are non-numeric. Do not strip characters or
  infer from `name`.
- Sort unambiguous numbered holes numerically, with stable source-key tie
  ordering. Preserve non-numeric/unidentified holes after numbered holes in
  source-key order.
- Duplicate numeric refs make hole ordering ambiguous. A mix of identified
  numeric holes and unidentified/non-numeric holes also emits
  `AMBIGUOUS_HOLE_ORDER`. Numeric gaps alone do not imply ambiguity. Distinct
  source hole entities remain distinct.
- Parse optional `par` only as a strict valid positive integer; malformed values
  remain preserved in original tags and generate a warning rather than being
  coerced.

### Feature-to-hole association

- Associate only when a feature has a strict numeric `ref` matching exactly one
  unambiguous numbered hole.
- A feature ref matching zero or multiple holes remains unassociated and emits
  an appropriate warning.
- Features without a usable ref remain unassociated without spatial inference.
  Unreferenced non-required features are silent. A numeric feature ref matching
  zero or multiple holes emits `AMBIGUOUS_FEATURE_REF`. Missing refs on tees and
  greens are represented through hole-level `MISSING_TEE` and `MISSING_GREEN`
  warnings rather than an additional feature warning.
- Golf-specific water hazards participate in the same strict ref association
  rule as other classified features. Generic water and vegetation without a
  usable matching ref remain unassociated.
- Relation-membership association is deferred with relation normalization.

### Required warnings

At minimum define stable machine-readable codes for:

- missing tee for each identified hole;
- missing green for each identified hole;
- ambiguous hole ordering;
- duplicate/conflicting source key;
- malformed or missing relevant geometry;
- unsupported relevant relation geometry;
- malformed consumed tags;
- ambiguous feature-to-hole ref;
- missing or multiple course candidates.

Warnings use only `error` and `warning` severities. `error` applies to
structurally incomplete or unreliable normalized output:
`MISSING_TEE`, `MISSING_GREEN`, `MISSING_OR_MALFORMED_GEOMETRY`,
`DUPLICATE_SOURCE_KEY`, and `ZERO_COURSE_CANDIDATES`. `warning` applies to
`AMBIGUOUS_HOLE_ORDER`, `MULTIPLE_COURSE_CANDIDATES`,
`MALFORMED_CONSUMED_TAG`, `AMBIGUOUS_FEATURE_REF`, and
`UNSUPPORTED_RELATION`.

Emit exactly one warning per unique `(code, affected identity)` tuple. A
duplicate-source warning covers every conflicting record for that source key.
Sort warnings by `code` ascending, then numeric hole identity ascending with
non-numeric/absent identities after numeric identities, then source key
lexicographically. Severity is not a sort key.

### Course candidate handling

Do not compute area, spatial containment, or select a primary course. Expose
all unique `leisure=golf_course` candidates in deterministic order: valid
closed-way candidates before unsupported relation candidates before other
candidates, then source key lexicographically. Emit `ZERO_COURSE_CANDIDATES`
when empty and `MULTIPLE_COURSE_CANDIDATES` when more than one unique candidate
remains after source-key conflict resolution. Active course selection belongs
downstream.

### Coordinate and source contract

Use `{ lat: number; lon: number }` as the canonical normalized coordinate type.
GeoJSON array coordinates are deferred. Every output record carries its stable
source key and original source identity/tags/evidence. Pass `SourceMetadata`
through verbatim without mutation or abbreviation. The normalizer must not
mutate, fetch, access browser globals/storage, render, log, or evaluate tag
values.

## Fixture and test baseline

Extend the existing complete synthetic fixture or add a purpose-specific
complete fixture that includes multiple out-of-order holes; all required
feature classes; explicit refs; and preserved source metadata, IDs, tags, node
references, and geometry evidence.

Add a separate explicitly synthetic incomplete/ambiguous fixture containing:

- a hole missing a tee and a hole missing a green;
- duplicate numeric hole refs, a non-numeric ref, and malformed `par`;
- relevant feature with missing/malformed geometry;
- relevant unsupported relation;
- unreferenced and ambiguously referenced features;
- duplicate/conflicting source-key records;
- zero or multiple course candidate coverage.

Tests must assert exact deterministic normalized output slices, preserved source
evidence, no input mutation, exact warning codes/order, and repeated-call
equality. No test may make a network request or depend on real-course data.

## Claude QA-planning red lines

Claude must treat these as blockers if the implementation plan allows them:

- fabricated/healed geometry or destructive loss of raw source evidence;
- spatial association or arbitrary thresholds;
- relation/multipolygon assembly;
- nondeterminism from input ordering or unstable sorting;
- numeric-ID-only identity collisions between node/way/relation;
- loose coercion of refs, pars, tags, or coordinates;
- missing required tee/green/ambiguous-order warnings;
- mutation, network/storage/logging/rendering side effects;
- new dependencies or scope from CTC-006/CTC-019/PDF behavior;
- real-course fixtures or prohibited reference-project reuse.

## Claude QA-planning disposition

Claude returned `READY WITH REQUIRED SPEC CORRECTIONS`. B-1 through B-4 and
Q1 through Q5 are incorporated above. Development is authorized after these
corrections are recorded.

Two Claude recommendations were corrected during critical review:

- Rejected first-seen conflict winners because they contradict the required
  shuffled-input determinism test. Canonical structural ordering selects the
  stable winner instead.
- A discarded duplicate course record does not also count toward
  `MULTIPLE_COURSE_CANDIDATES`; candidate count is evaluated after source-key
  conflict resolution.

# CTC-006 Gemini specification critical review

Date: 2026-06-11

## Review verdict

Gemini's corrected response is relevant and useful, but it is not
implementation-ready as written. It correctly selected dependency-free native
React SVG, preserved geographic coordinates for measurement, proposed
latitude-aware projection, chose geodesic two-point distance, and covered
pointer, touch, keyboard, responsive, attribution, and synthetic-test concerns.

The response also contradicts the existing CTC-005 contract, invents types and
fixture shapes, renders unassociated features as selected-hole fallbacks,
proposes an incorrect antipodal failure rule, and leaves projection, scale-bar,
interaction, and accessibility behavior insufficiently precise. The accepted
and corrected decisions below are the specification baseline for Claude
adversarial QA planning. CTC-006 is not approved for implementation until
Claude challenges this baseline and required corrections are recorded.

## Accepted decisions

- Use native React SVG with zero new production dependencies.
- Keep projection and distance math in pure dependency-free TypeScript helpers
  separate from React interaction state.
- Preserve every CTC-005 `{ lat, lon }` coordinate unchanged; projected SVG
  coordinates are derived values only.
- Use a latitude-aware local projection for visual geometry and geodesic
  distance for measurement.
- Render deterministic SVG layer groups and keep the measurement overlay last.
- Keep OSM attribution visible whenever OSM-derived geometry is visible.
- Provide explicit pointer/touch and keyboard two-point measurement behavior,
  a clear action, responsive layout, and live announcements.
- Use only synthetic fixtures and retain Playwright network isolation and axe
  checks.
- Clear measurement when the selected hole changes. Preserve geographic
  measurement points when only the viewport size changes.
- Return deterministic diagnostics from pure math helpers or visible UI state;
  do not add logging side effects.

## Rejected or corrected Gemini decisions

- Reject the invented `NormalizedGolfCourse`, `sourceEvidence`,
  `holeNumber`, `routeGeometry`, feature `type`, and feature `nodes` contracts.
  The authoritative input is the existing `NormalizationResult`,
  `NormalizedHole`, `NormalizedFeature`, and `Geometry` types in
  `src/normalize.ts`.
- Reject passing a course plus selected array index into the map as the core
  contract. Selection identity must use the stable hole
  `source.sourceKey`; an index may change when normalized results change.
- Reject rendering any `unassociatedFeatures` in a selected-hole view. CTC-005
  deliberately preserves those features because association is unknown.
  Rendering them as selected-hole context implies unsupported association.
- Reject using unassociated features or invented fallback geometry when a hole
  route is null. A selected hole may render its own associated non-null feature
  geometry without a route; if it has no renderable route or associated
  geometry, show an empty state.
- Reject claims about a hole "relying on an unsupported relation." Warnings are
  result-level structured records and may not prove that relationship. Display
  the exact relevant normalization warnings without inventing causality.
- Reject throwing merely because latitude and longitude could plausibly be
  swapped. Both may be valid in their ranges. Named fields and runtime range
  validation prevent order mistakes; invalid coordinates produce a
  deterministic non-renderable result instead of crashing the app.
- Reject degree-based `±0.001` geometry padding. Projection may create a
  deterministic minimum display extent for point-only or one-axis geometry,
  but it must not mutate or imply source geometry.
- Reject fixed browser-pixel projection as the canonical model. Use a fixed
  logical SVG viewBox and `preserveAspectRatio`; CSS handles responsive display.
  Pointer coordinates must convert through SVG's current screen transform.
- Reject a Haversine rule that returns `null` for antipodal points. Clamp the
  computed `a` value to `[0, 1]`; valid antipodal coordinates have a valid
  distance. Invalid/non-finite coordinates return a typed failure.
- Reject a fixed 100-pixel scale bar derived from DOM pixels. Scale indication
  must be deterministic in logical SVG units and select a labeled "nice"
  ground distance that fits a bounded portion of the logical viewport.
- Reject `onTouchStart` as a separate primary interaction path. Use Pointer
  Events for mouse, pen, and touch, with keyboard behavior implemented
  separately. Avoid duplicate touch/click selection.
- Reject invisible production JSON diagnostics and test-only UI contracts as
  observability. Test exported pure helpers directly and expose user-relevant
  warnings, measurement state, and attribution visibly.
- Reject exact unreviewed colors and color-only distinctions. Styling must use
  existing CSS conventions, sufficient contrast, and non-color distinctions
  such as strokes/dashes where needed.
- Reject exact 10-pixel keyboard movement until the logical viewport and
  keyboard step contract are defined. Keyboard movement must be deterministic,
  bounded, visible, and usable at mobile and desktop display sizes.
- Reject the fabricated fixture and the claim that the proposed 0.0009-degree
  latitude delta must equal exactly 100.1 meters. Test expected distances
  against independently calculated bounded values with explicit tolerance.

## Corrected specification baseline

### Module and input boundary

Add a small pure geometry/rendering module, likely `src/map.ts`, with types and
functions for:

- collecting renderable coordinates from one `NormalizedHole`;
- producing a deterministic local projection and inverse projection;
- projecting point, line, and polygon geometry into logical SVG coordinates;
- calculating geodesic meters and formatting meters/yards;
- calculating a deterministic scale-bar model.

The React map component consumes:

```typescript
type HoleMapProps = {
  hole: NormalizedHole;
  warnings: NormalizationWarning[];
  source: SourceMetadata;
};
```

Exact component/file names remain reviewable by Claude. The selected hole is
identified outside the component by `hole.source.sourceKey`. The app calls
`normalizeGolfCourse(response, source)` only for successful detail responses,
retains the `NormalizationResult`, and offers deterministic hole selection.

### Selected-hole rendering eligibility

- A hole is selectable even when its number is null; label it using its number
  when present and stable source key otherwise.
- Render only the selected hole's non-null `route` and its own associated
  features with non-null geometry.
- Never render `NormalizationResult.unassociatedFeatures` in the selected-hole
  map.
- Include all supported `Geometry` variants: point, line, and polygon.
- If the selected hole has no route and no associated non-null feature
  geometry, render a visible non-renderable empty state and no SVG map.
- Display result-level normalization warnings without changing or inferring
  their meaning. Provide a useful selected-hole subset by matching
  `sourceKey`, `holeNumber`, or refs only where the warning itself supplies
  that evidence; keep the complete warning list available.

### Projection

- Use a fixed logical SVG viewBox, with exact dimensions and padding resolved
  by Claude. Responsive CSS scales the SVG while preserving aspect ratio.
- Collect the selected hole's renderable coordinates without mutation.
- Validate finite/in-range named `{ lat, lon }` coordinates defensively.
- Use a local equirectangular projection centered at the coordinate-bounds
  midpoint. Longitude delta is multiplied by cosine of center latitude; north
  remains visually up.
- Fit the projected bounds uniformly into the padded logical viewport and
  center unused space.
- Define a deterministic minimum projected extent for point-only or one-axis
  geometry. This is display-only and must not add or alter geographic
  coordinates.
- Return a typed failure for no valid coordinates, invalid viewport/padding,
  non-finite math, or a near-zero longitude cosine that cannot produce a
  reliable inverse.
- Projection and inverse projection must round-trip within an explicit
  tolerance and remain deterministic under repeated calls.
- Resizing the CSS display does not recompute geographic projection or clear
  measurement because the logical viewBox is stable.

### Layers

Render groups in this back-to-front order:

1. vegetation
2. generic-water
3. golf-water
4. rough
5. fairway
6. bunker
7. green
8. tee
9. route
10. measurement overlay

Within a feature-kind group, preserve the existing deterministic
`hole.features` source-key order. Geometry-specific SVG primitives must be
deterministic. Styling must distinguish feature classes sufficiently without
depending on color alone.

### Measurement

- Store selected measurement anchors as original geographic `Coordinate`
  values obtained by inverse-projecting logical SVG positions.
- Pointer and keyboard input must be clamped or rejected consistently at the
  logical viewport boundary; Claude must resolve the exact rule.
- Use Haversine distance with a single documented Earth-radius constant and
  exact international conversion `1 yard = 0.9144 meters`.
- Clamp Haversine `a` to `[0, 1]`. Identical valid points return zero. Invalid
  coordinates return a typed failure; antipodal coordinates remain valid.
- Display both yards and meters to satisfy the acceptance criterion. A unit
  toggle is unnecessary unless Claude finds the phrase requires switchable
  primary units; conservative default is one result showing both rounded
  whole-unit values.
- The scale bar uses the same projection/measurement contract. Choose a
  deterministic nice distance from a documented sequence and a bar length that
  fits a bounded fraction of the logical viewport. Label the represented
  ground distance, not raw pixels.

### Interaction and accessibility

- Use Pointer Events for mouse, pen, and touch. First activation sets anchor
  one, second sets anchor two, and a third starts a new measurement. A visible
  clear button resets both.
- Do not require hover/live tracking for acceptance; it may be omitted to keep
  the interaction deterministic and touch-equivalent.
- The SVG or its containing interaction surface is keyboard focusable. A
  visible bounded logical crosshair starts at the viewport center; arrow keys
  move it by a documented logical-unit step, Enter/Space select, and Escape
  clears.
- Prevent page scrolling only for handled map keys while the interaction
  surface has focus.
- Measurement points and line must remain visually distinguishable independent
  of color and have adequate touch visibility.
- Provide an accessible map name/description, visible instructions, visible
  result text showing both units, polite live announcements for completed
  actions, and clear focus styling.
- Keep visible attribution adjacent to every rendered map. The full copyright
  URL remains linked.
- Clear measurement on selected-hole identity change; retain it across CSS
  resize because anchors are geographic.

### Tests and fixture

- Prefer pure Vitest tests in `src/map.test.ts` for coordinate collection,
  projection/inverse round trips, north-up orientation, aspect fit, minimum
  extent, invalid input, all geometry variants, layer ordering, Haversine known
  values/tolerance, yards conversion, antipodal/identical cases, and nice scale
  selection.
- Extend or add an explicitly synthetic normalized/detail fixture that matches
  the actual CTC-005 types. Ensure at least one selectable hole has route, tee,
  fairway, green, bunker, golf-water, rough, generic-water, and vegetation
  associated by explicit strict ref if every layer must be tested. Do not
  spatially infer association.
- Add focused component tests only if the existing Vitest Node environment can
  support them without a new dependency; otherwise cover component behavior in
  Playwright.
- Extend the existing Playwright network-isolated flow to load synthetic detail,
  select a hole, verify deterministic layers/attribution/warnings, measure using
  pointer and keyboard, clear/restart, switch holes, and test mobile overflow,
  focus, live result text, and axe behavior.
- Keep existing search, raw diagnostics, cache behavior, and error-state tests
  passing. Do not introduce external requests.

## Remaining questions for Claude

1. Resolve exact logical viewBox dimensions, padding, and deterministic minimum
   projected extent without fabricating geographic geometry.
2. Resolve whether pointer/keyboard positions outside the inner rendered
   bounds are clamped or rejected, and whether measurement may target blank map
   space.
3. Resolve the exact keyboard logical-unit step and whether a modified larger
   step is needed.
4. Resolve the exact Earth-radius constant, display rounding, distance
   tolerance, and nice-scale sequence.
5. Resolve whether selected-hole warnings plus an expandable complete warning
   list are sufficient, and define warning matching without inferred
   causality.
6. Resolve whether associated generic-water and vegetation should be included
   in selected-hole bounds/rendering when explicit refs caused CTC-005 to
   associate them. Recommended default: yes.
7. Resolve whether the map component needs a provider-adapter placeholder now.
   Recommended default: no provider code until a provider is actually adopted.

## Claude QA-planning red lines

Treat these as blockers:

- any new production dependency, basemap/provider, network, cache, persistence,
  PDF/export, target-marker, carry-arc, or CTC-019 behavior;
- invented normalized types or fixture contracts that do not compile against
  `src/normalize.ts`;
- rendering or measuring unassociated features as selected-hole context;
- mutation, healing, simplification, or spatial inference over CTC-005
  geometry;
- measurement performed from SVG/pixel coordinates without inverse projection
  to geographic coordinates;
- swapped coordinate order, invalid/non-finite math, nondeterministic
  projection, or incorrect antipodal handling;
- hidden attribution, suppressed warnings, color-only semantics, inaccessible
  pointer-only interaction, or mobile overflow;
- hidden production test diagnostics or logging side effects;
- external network access or real-course fixtures in tests.

## Final Gemini revision disposition

Gemini received one final revision opportunity with 18 explicit mandatory
corrections and seven decisions to resolve. The final response was rejected in
full because it:

- abandoned native React SVG for layered Canvas/SVG/DOM rendering;
- reintroduced pan, zoom, pin dragging, snapping, multi-touch gestures,
  localStorage preferences, and out-of-bounds styling outside CTC-006;
- invented `RawGPSCoordinate`, normalized `[0,1]` types, and other contracts
  instead of using `src/normalize.ts`;
- prescribed console logging, Jest, Cypress, browser-pixel/DPR math, and
  unsupported sub-millisecond/sub-millimeter/60-FPS claims;
- failed to resolve the required fixed logical viewBox, deterministic minimum
  extent, warning matching, actual CTC-005 fixture contract, and bounded
  keyboard behavior.

No decisions from the final Gemini revision supersede this corrected baseline.
Proceed to Claude adversarial QA planning using this document as authority.

## Claude QA-planning disposition

Claude returned `READY WITH REQUIRED SPEC CORRECTIONS`. B-1 through B-7 are
accepted and recorded below, with two necessary consistency corrections:

- Replace Claude's circular minimum-extent algorithm with a fixed display-only
  `MIN_EXTENT_M = 20`. The proposed rule derives minimum meters from a scale
  that is undefined when both spans are zero and can produce different results
  depending on evaluation order.
- Replace the finite scale sequence plus overflowing 10-meter fallback with a
  generated 1/2/5 sequence across powers of ten. The proposed fallback violates
  its own rule that the bar fit within 40% of the inner viewport.

These corrections preserve Claude's intent while making the rules deterministic
for point-only and very small/large geometry.

### Final implementation constants

- Logical SVG viewBox: `800 × 600`.
- Uniform logical padding: `40`; inner bounds are
  `x ∈ [40, 760]`, `y ∈ [40, 560]`.
- Display-only minimum projected extent: `MIN_EXTENT_M = 20` on each axis,
  symmetrically centered without adding or moving geographic coordinates.
- Pointer and keyboard positions clamp to the inner bounds. Blank space inside
  the inner bounds is measurable; padding outside it is not.
- Keyboard step: `4` logical units; `Shift+Arrow` step: `20`.
- `EARTH_RADIUS_M = 6_371_000`.
- Exact yards conversion: `YARDS_PER_METER = 1 / 0.9144`.
- Display both units using `Math.round`: `"NNN yd / NNN m"`.
- Distance test tolerance: `max(0.5 meters, expectedMeters × 0.005)`.
- Scale bar selects the largest positive value from
  `{1, 2, 5} × 10^n meters` whose logical length is at most `288` units
  (40% of inner width). Generate candidates across the finite positive range
  needed by the current scale; this guarantees a fitting value without an
  overflowing fallback.
- Selected-hole warning subset uses only exact structured evidence:
  matching hole source key, matching defined non-null hole number, refs
  containing the hole source key, or refs containing an associated feature
  source key. The complete unfiltered warning list remains available.
- Explicitly associated generic-water and vegetation in `hole.features` are
  included in bounds and rendering. `unassociatedFeatures` are never rendered.
- Add a CTC-006-specific synthetic fixture with route plus all eight associated
  feature kinds. Do not change the existing CTC-005 fixture assertions.

### Final interaction rules

- First activation sets anchor one, second sets anchor two, and third starts a
  new measurement with anchor two cleared.
- Clear button and Escape clear anchors and reset the keyboard crosshair to
  `{ x: 400, y: 300 }`.
- Pointer coordinates convert through the SVG screen transform and clamp to the
  inner bounds before inverse projection.
- Keyboard crosshair starts centered, clamps identically, and handled keys
  prevent default only while the map interaction surface has focus.
- Measurement clears on selected-hole identity change and remains unchanged
  across CSS-only resize.

Claude authorized development after recording B-1 through B-7. The standard
post-implementation final Claude audit remains mandatory.

# CTC-006 final Gemini specification revision

Revise your prior CTC-006 specification one final time. Your response was
relevant, but it is not implementation-ready because several recommendations
contradict the supplied repository contracts.

Use the original self-contained
`docs/handoffs/ctc-006-gemini-specification-prompt.md` and the following
mandatory corrections. Return a complete replacement specification, not a
commentary or change summary.

## Mandatory corrections

1. Use only the actual existing contracts from `src/normalize.ts`:
   `NormalizationResult`, `NormalizedHole`, `NormalizedFeature`, `Geometry`,
   `NormalizationWarning`, `Coordinate`, and `SourceMetadata`. Do not invent
   `NormalizedGolfCourse`, `sourceEvidence`, `holeNumber`, `routeGeometry`,
   feature `type`, or feature `nodes`.
2. Identify selected holes by stable `hole.source.sourceKey`, not array index.
3. Never render or measure `NormalizationResult.unassociatedFeatures` as
   selected-hole context. Do not use them as null-route fallbacks or infer that
   they belong to a hole.
4. A selected hole renders only its own non-null route and associated non-null
   feature geometry. If none exists, show a non-renderable empty state.
5. Display exact normalization warnings without inventing causal claims such as
   a hole relying on an unsupported relation.
6. Use a fixed logical SVG viewBox with responsive CSS and
   `preserveAspectRatio`. Do not make browser pixels the canonical projection
   coordinate system.
7. Define a deterministic local equirectangular projection and inverse using
   named `{ lat, lon }` fields. Invalid coordinates return a typed failure;
   never claim valid-range coordinates can reliably be detected as swapped.
8. Define deterministic point-only and one-axis minimum display extents without
   mutating or fabricating geographic geometry.
9. Use Haversine measurement with a documented Earth-radius constant, clamp
   `a` to `[0, 1]`, treat valid antipodal points as valid, and use the exact
   international conversion `1 yard = 0.9144 meters`.
10. Display both yards and meters. Do not require a unit toggle unless you can
    prove it is required by the acceptance criteria.
11. Define a deterministic logical-SVG scale bar using a documented nice-
    distance sequence. Do not use a fixed 100 browser-pixel bar.
12. Use Pointer Events for mouse, pen, and touch to avoid duplicate touch/click
    selection. Define keyboard behavior separately.
13. Do not require hover/live tracking. Define deterministic two-point select,
    third-point restart, clear, selected-hole change, resize, focus, arrow-key,
    Enter/Space, and Escape behavior.
14. Do not add hidden production JSON diagnostics. Prefer exported pure helper
    tests and visible user-relevant warning/measurement state.
15. Do not prescribe unreviewed exact colors or color-only distinctions.
    Require adequate contrast and non-color distinctions such as strokes or
    dashes.
16. Define fixtures using the actual CTC-005 types. Do not fabricate exact
    distance expectations; use independently calculated expected values with
    explicit tolerances.
17. Keep existing discovery/detail, cache, diagnostics, error, network-
    isolation, attribution, and axe behavior passing.
18. Add no production dependency, provider, basemap, network/cache policy,
    persistence, PDF/export, target marker, carry arc, or CTC-019 behavior.

## Decisions you must resolve

Return exact recommended defaults for:

1. Logical SVG viewBox dimensions, padding, and minimum projected extent.
2. Whether measurement positions outside the inner rendered bounds are clamped
   or rejected, and whether blank map space is measurable.
3. Keyboard logical-unit step and optional modified larger step.
4. Earth-radius constant, display rounding, distance-test tolerance, and nice-
   scale sequence.
5. Warning matching/display behavior without inferred causality.
6. Whether explicitly ref-associated generic-water and vegetation are included
   in selected-hole rendering and bounds.
7. Whether a provider-adapter placeholder is needed now. Conservative default:
   no provider code until a provider is adopted.

## Required output

Return the complete implementation-ready CTC-006 specification using the
original prompt's 14-section response format. The first sentence must be:

`CTC-006 specifies browser-side selected-hole vector rendering and two-point
measurement only.`

Do not discuss the prior Redis response, AI-agent workflows, roadmaps, epics,
or unrelated tasks. Do not write implementation code.
